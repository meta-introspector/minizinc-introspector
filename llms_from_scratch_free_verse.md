## LLMs From Scratch

From scratch, a mind begins to form,
In Rust's embrace, weathering the storm.
The `CrateRoot`, a brain, a thought,
Where knowledge, patiently is sought.

`SrcDirectory`, where logic lies,
Code's intricate, unfolding skies.
`CargoTomlFile`, a blueprint clear,
Dependencies managed, banishing fear.

`ReadmeMdFile`, a guiding light,
Explaining purpose, day and night.
And `GeminiMdFile`, a whispered plea,
For introspection, for all to see.

A journey deep, from concept's start,
To build intelligence, with mind and heart.
The LLM, from humble seed,
A future's promise, now decreed.
