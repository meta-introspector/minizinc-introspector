feat: Add build and run scripts

This commit introduces a `scripts/` directory containing helper scripts to automate the build and execution processes for the `libminizinc` project.

- `scripts/build_gecode.sh`: Automates the Gecode build process.
- `scripts/build_libminizinc.sh`: Automates the `libminizinc` build process, including Gecode integration.
- `scripts/setup_minizinc_solvers.sh`: Automates the creation and placement of `gecode.msc` for solver discovery.
- `scripts/run_embedding_model.sh`: Runs the `embedding_sphere.mzn` model with `example.dzn`.

These scripts improve reproducibility and simplify the workflow for working on the project.
