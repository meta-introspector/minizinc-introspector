fix: Add null checks for Flattener->getEnv() in C wrapper

Added defensive null checks for the return value of `Flattener::getEnv()` in `minizinc_parse_model` and `minizinc_parse_data_from_string` to prevent crashes if the environment is not properly initialized after `flatten()` is called. This provides more robust error handling and debugging information.
