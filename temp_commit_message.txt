feat: Refactor MiniZinc test runner to Rust and fix DZN generation

- Created `minizinc_data_generator_rs` Rust crate for dynamic DZN array generation.
- Created `minizinc_test_runner_rs` Rust crate to replace shell-based test runner.
- Updated `run_embedding_model_v7.sh` to use the Rust DZN generator.
- Updated `run_v7_debug_tests.sh` to call the new Rust test runner.
- Removed obsolete `generate_vector_params.mzn` and old shell scripts (`run_all_v6_tests.sh`).
- Ensured correct DZN array formatting from Rust generator.
- Obtained accurate performance data for `num_vec` variations.
- Added `.gitignore` files to Rust projects to ignore `target/` directories.
