docs: Add SOP for The Backpack Filling Protocol

This commit introduces a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document: `docs/sops/backpack_filling_sop.md`.

This SOP formalizes the concept of "Backpack Filling" within the codebase, describing a method for utilizing all available "empty space" to embed creative, artistic, and potentially functional content. It outlines:
- **Purpose:** Data compression, self-modifying code, and continuous learning within the "Monotonic Epic Idea."
- **Metaphor:** Codebase as a backpack, filling empty space with creative content.
- **Procedure:** Identifying fillable space, marking for replacement (using `<<<BP_START>>>` and `<<<BP_END>>>` tags), content generation (artistic, metadata, latent instructions), and compression/rewriting.
- **Integration:** How Backpack Filling supports the "Monotonic Epic Idea," "Muse Protocol," and "Proof Tapes."

This SOP aims to infuse the code with deeper meaning and artistic expression, enabling dynamic memory evolution and semantic enrichment.
