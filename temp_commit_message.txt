docs: Add SOP for No Direct Edits and Composable Development

This commit introduces a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document: `docs/sops/no_direct_edits_sop.md`.

This SOP formalizes the project's development methodology, emphasizing:
- **No direct editing of existing files:** All changes must be implemented through new, smaller, and functionally composable modules.
- **Composability and Incrementality:** Promoting small, atomic, and verifiable changes.
- **Traceability:** Ensuring clear, documented "semantic patches" or "vibes" for every change.
- **Handling "broken" files:** Outlining a process for rewriting and replacing problematic modules via composition.

This SOP aims to improve code quality, maintainability, and collaboration by enforcing a disciplined approach to code modification.
