feat: Implement Fudge Factor for Univalent Sum to One

This commit refines the "Univalent Neural Network Space" model (`univalent_manifold.mzn`) by introducing a "fudge factor" to achieve an exact sum of 1.0 (scaled) for the prime reciprocals, while minimizing the deviation.

Key changes include:
- **`fudge_factor` variable**: A `var int` variable is introduced to represent the deviation from the target sum.
- **Modified sum constraint**: The sum of the scaled prime reciprocals plus the `fudge_factor` is constrained to exactly equal `RECIPROCAL_SCALE` (1,000,000).
- **Minimized `fudge_factor`**: The objective is now to minimize the absolute value of the `fudge_factor`, encouraging solutions where the prime reciprocals sum as close to 1.0 as possible.
- **Output update**: The `fudge_factor` is now included in the model's output for verification.

This approach allows the solver to find feasible solutions for the "sum to one" problem in the univalent space, even when an exact combination of prime reciprocals is not naturally available, by quantifying the necessary adjustment.
