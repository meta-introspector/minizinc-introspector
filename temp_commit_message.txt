feat: Implement Partitioned Manifold Concept

This commit introduces the concept of a "Partitioned Manifold" where coordinates are selected from a predefined set of `P` discrete values, allowing for a more granular representation of the manifold space.

Key changes include:
- **`partitioned_manifold_params.mzn`**: Defines the number of partitions `P` (currently 5) and an array `partition_values` that maps integer indices to specific float values (evenly spaced between -1.0 and 1.0).
- **`partitioned_manifold.mzn`**: 
    - Models a 2-dimensional space where each coordinate is an index into the `partition_values` array.
    - Includes a `get_partition_value` function to retrieve the actual float value from the `partition_values` array.
    - Includes a constraint that two points in this manifold must be different.

This demonstrates a modular approach to defining the coordinate space, allowing for easy scaling of the number of partitions and dimensions, and provides a foundation for integrating this concept into the larger embedding problem.
