Fix: Revert build.rs to standard C library linking approach

- Reverted `build.rs` in `tools/minizinc_ffi/` to use `cargo:rustc-link-search=native=...` and `cargo:rustc-link-lib=...`.
- This is the standard and recommended way to link external C libraries in Rust, and should resolve the persistent linker errors.
