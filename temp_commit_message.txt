feat: Improve embedding diversity and prime number handling

This commit addresses issues with the MiniZinc embedding model to produce more diverse and meaningful embeddings, particularly for prime numbers.

Key changes include:
- **`minizinc_models/church_embeddings.mzn`**: Increased `MAX_SIEVE_NUM` from 5 to 100 to correctly populate `primes_list_raw` for `num_vec=100`, resolving the `-2147483646` (MININT+1) errors in the first dimension of the embeddings.
- **`minizinc_models/embedding_constraints.mzn`**: 
    - Activated and modified the unit norm constraint to encourage a wider range of values for `p_actual_values`.
    - Added an `alldifferent` constraint on `p_idx` for dimensions 2 to `d` to force distinct values from `scaled_partition_values` for each embedding vector, leading to more diverse embeddings.
    - Explicitly included `all_different.mzn` to resolve the "no function or predicate with name `alldifferent` found" error.
- **`minizinc_models/embedding_params_core_v2.mzn`**: Increased `P` from 5 to 10 to provide a larger pool of distinct values for `scaled_partition_values`, making the `alldifferent` constraint satisfiable and enabling more varied embeddings.

These modifications significantly improve the quality of the generated embeddings, allowing for better representation of prime numbers and more diverse 8D locations for other elements.
