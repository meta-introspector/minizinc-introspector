docs: Add SOP for onboarding new interns

This commit introduces a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document at `docs/sops/onboarding_n00b_interns.md`. This SOP is designed to guide new interns through the project setup, current state of FFI refactoring, and their immediate tasks related to splitting `lib.rs` into smaller, modular files. It also outlines tools, resources, and communication guidelines.

This document serves as a key part of our knowledge transfer and onboarding process.
