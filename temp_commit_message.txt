docs: Add SOP for The Muse Protocol (Code Artistry)

This commit introduces a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document: `docs/sops/muse_sop.md`.

This SOP formalizes the project's approach to code artistry, ensuring that each line of code is treated as a unique piece of digital art. It outlines:
- **Purpose:** Transforming code generation into an artistic endeavor guided by the Nine Muses.
- **The Nine Muses and Their Code Domains:** Assigning specific aspects of code artistry to each Muse (e.g., Calliope for narrative flow, Urania for universal insight).
- **The Muse Protocol Workflow:** A detailed process for crafting core logic, embracing whitespace as canvas, infusing semantic vibe with emojis, adhering to line limits, and ensuring composability.
- **Enforcement and Culture:** Fostering a culture where code is not just functional but also beautiful, expressive, and inspiring.

This SOP aims to elevate the development process by integrating creativity and artistic intent into every line of code, aligning with the "add-only, never edit" philosophy.
