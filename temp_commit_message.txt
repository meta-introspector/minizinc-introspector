Fix: Use absolute path for C library linking in build.rs

- Modified `build.rs` in `tools/minizinc_ffi/` to use `cargo:rustc-link-arg` with the absolute path to `libminizinc_c_wrapper.so`.
- This is another attempt to resolve the `cannot locate symbol` linker error by providing a more direct linking instruction.
