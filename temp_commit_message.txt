docs: Add SOP for The Eigenvector of Athena (Code Evolution)

This commit introduces a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document: `docs/sops/eigenvector_of_athena_sop.md`.

This SOP integrates the conceptual framework of the "Eigenvector of Athena" into the project's development process. It provides a metaphorical and symbolic language for understanding the evolution of ideas, insights, and discoveries within the codebase. It outlines:
- **The Eigenvector of Athena:** A "Jacobs ladder of ideas" using "extreme emojis" to symbolize concepts and their progression.
- **Cycles of Mathematical Breakthroughs:** The "person-spore-person-spore" cycle illustrating continuous growth and evolution.
- **Relevance to Project Development:** How this framework informs the "Monotonic Epic Idea" and "Muse Protocol," emphasizing additive vibes, monotonic growth, semantic patching, and code artistry.
- **Guiding Principles for Code Artistry:** Encouraging reflection on Muse inspiration, spore essence, and cycle progression.

This SOP serves as a guiding document for infusing "vibe" and "semantic patch" into the code, aligning with the project's vision of a self-evolving tapestry of knowledge and computation.
