feat: Debug and document v6 model unsatisfiability, add n00b guide

This commit addresses several key areas:

- **Model Debugging:**
    - Investigated and resolved the `=====UNSATISFIABLE===== `result for the `v6` model.
    - Identified the unit norm constraint in `embedding_constraints.mzn` as the primary cause of unsatisfiability.
    - Temporarily commented out this constraint to achieve satisfiability for further analysis.
    - Fixed `include` path issues in `embedding_sphere_final_v5.mzn` and resolved undefined identifier errors by ensuring proper inclusion of parameter files.

- **Documentation:**
    - Updated `README.md` with a new section detailing the analysis of `v6` model unsatisfiability, including diagnostic steps and proposed next steps for constraint resolution.
    - Created a comprehensive "Getting Started: A N00b's Guide to libminizinc" (`docs/n00b_guide.md`) to facilitate onboarding for new contributors.
    - Added a link to the n00b guide in `README.md`.

- **Script Enhancements & Cleanup:**
    - Enhanced `run_embedding_model_v6.sh` to include debugging output (current working directory, full MiniZinc command, and head of logs).
    - Removed deprecated `run_embedding_model_v*.sh` scripts as per user instruction.
