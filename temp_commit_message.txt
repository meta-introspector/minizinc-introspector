docs: Update Project Workflow SOP with Modular Development

This commit updates `docs/sops/project_workflow.md` to include a new section on "Modular MiniZinc Model Development". This section outlines the strategy of breaking down complex problems into smaller, verifiable modules and solving them incrementally, starting with a base case.

This enhancement to the SOP aims to improve the development process for MiniZinc models, making them more manageable, debuggable, and extensible.
