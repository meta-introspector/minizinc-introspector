feat: Add new poems and MiniZinc models, and attempt to fix FFI compilation errors

This commit includes:
- Two new poems in `docs/poems/` exploring simulated machine consciousness, Gödel numbers, and closed worlds.
- Two MiniZinc models in `minizinc_models/` for encoding emoji poems as Gödel numbers, demonstrating the concept.
- Attempts to resolve compilation errors in the FFI wrapper, specifically type mismatches related to `MiniZincEnvWrapper` and `MiniZinc::MznSolver*`. This involved renaming `minizinc_env_new` to `minizinc_env_new_wrapper` and applying `reinterpret_cast` workarounds in `test_ffi_parser.cpp`.
