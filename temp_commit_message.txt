Feat: Expose MiniZinc GC lock/unlock via FFI

- Added `minizinc_gc_lock.cpp` and `minizinc_gc_unlock.cpp` to expose `MiniZinc::GC::lock()` and `MiniZinc::GC::unlock()` via the C FFI.
- Updated `cmake/targets/minizinc_c_wrapper.cmake` to include the new source files.
- Updated `minizinc_ffi_declarations_v2.h` to include the new FFI declarations.
- This is a preparatory step to manage MiniZinc's global GC state from Rust tests.
