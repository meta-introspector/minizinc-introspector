refactor: Extract expression FFI declarations and sources into separate files

This commit refactors the MiniZinc C++ FFI by extracting all declarations and source file paths related to `MiniZinc::Expression` and its subclasses into dedicated files. This addresses the issue of `CMakeLists.txt` and `minizinc_ffi_declarations.h` becoming unwieldy due to repeated declarations and source file entries.

Changes include:
- Created `tools/minizinc_c_wrapper_refactored/minizinc_expression_declarations.h` to house all FFI declarations for expression types.
- Cleaned up `tools/minizinc_c_wrapper_refactored/minizinc_ffi_declarations.h` by removing the moved declarations and adding an `#include` statement for the new header.
- Created `cmake/targets/minizinc_expression_sources.cmake` to list all source files related to expression types.
- Cleaned up `cmake/targets/minizinc_c_wrapper.cmake` by removing the moved source file paths and adding an `include` statement for the new CMake file.

This refactoring improves modularity, readability, and maintainability of the FFI, making it easier to extend in the future.
