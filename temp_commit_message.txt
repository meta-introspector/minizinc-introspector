feat: Implement FFI for MiniZinc solving and integer solution extraction

This commit introduces the foundational FFI for MiniZinc model solving and integer solution extraction. Key changes include:

- **C++ FFI for Solver:** Added `minizinc_solver_run`, `minizinc_solver_free`, `minizinc_solver_get_solver_instance`, `minizinc_solver_instance_next`, `minizinc_solver_instance_print_solution`, and `minizinc_solver_instance_get_solution_value_int` to the C++ wrapper.
- **Rust FFI Bindings:** Updated `ffi_bindings.rs` with corresponding `extern "C"` declarations.
- **Rust Environment Methods:** Modularized `MiniZincEnvironment` with new methods for running models, getting solver instances, iterating solutions, printing solutions, and extracting integer values.
- **CMake Updates:** Modified `cmake/targets/minizinc_c_wrapper.cmake` to include new C++ source files.
- **Rust Test:** Added `test_solve_and_extract_int` to `tools/minizinc_ffi/src/tests/mod.rs` to verify the new solving and extraction functionality.
