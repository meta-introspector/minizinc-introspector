Feat: Add build.rs for robust C library linking in Rust tests

- Created `build.rs` in `tools/minizinc_ffi/` to instruct Cargo on how to find and link `libminizinc_c_wrapper.so`.
- This addresses the `cannot locate symbol` linker error by providing a more robust linking mechanism than `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
