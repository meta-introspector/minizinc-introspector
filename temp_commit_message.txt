feat: Improve FFI string handling and modularize Rust environment

This commit refactors the MiniZinc FFI to correctly handle C-allocated strings, specifically for `model_get_filepath`. A new C function `minizinc_string_free` is introduced to deallocate these strings, and a `MiniZincString` wrapper is added to the Rust FFI to ensure proper memory management via `Drop` implementation.

Additionally, the Rust FFI environment has been further modularized by extracting `impl_parse_string` into its own file, adhering to the 'one declaration per file' principle.
