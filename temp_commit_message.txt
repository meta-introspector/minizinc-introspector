Feat: Implement global GC lock/unlock in Rust tests

- Added FFI bindings for `minizinc_gc_lock()` and `minizinc_gc_unlock()` in `tools/minizinc_ffi/src/ffi_bindings.rs`.
- Modified `tools/minizinc_ffi/src/tests/mod.rs` to call `minizinc_gc_lock()` once at the beginning of the test module using `std::sync::Once`.
- This aims to resolve the `GC::alloc()` assertion and segmentation faults by ensuring the MiniZinc garbage collector is properly locked during Rust test execution.
