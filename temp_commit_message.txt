docs: Add Project Workflow SOP

This commit introduces `docs/sops/project_workflow.md`, a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document detailing the workflow for developing on the `libminizinc` project. It covers:

- Handling Gecode build issues (CMake, C++ compilation, submodule management).
- Configuring `libminizinc` to correctly integrate with Gecode.
- MiniZinc solver discovery via `.msc` files.
- Debugging common MiniZinc model type errors.
- The current approach to integer discretization for floating-point values.
- General project practices, including Git submodule handling and commit message conventions.

This SOP aims to streamline future development, ensure adherence to best practices (QA, ISO 9000, ITIL, GMP, Six Sigma), and provide a clear reference for common issues and their resolutions.
