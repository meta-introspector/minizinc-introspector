feat: Implement comprehensive MiniZinc model testing framework

This commit introduces a robust testing framework for MiniZinc models, enabling systematic performance analysis and bottleneck identification.

Key changes include:
- **`scripts/run_minizinc_test.sh`**: A generic script to run individual MiniZinc models, capture their output, and measure execution time using `date` for precision. It now utilizes MiniZinc's `--time-limit` for controlled execution.
- **`scripts/run_all_minizinc_tests.sh`**: A driver script that iterates through all `.mzn` files, executes them using `run_minizinc_test.sh`, and reports on their individual runtimes. It includes logic to provide necessary `.dzn` data files for specific models.
- **`minizinc_data/partitioned_manifold_minimal.dzn`**: A new data file providing minimal parameters for `partitioned_manifold.mzn` and `test_unit_norm.mzn`.
- **`minizinc_models/partitioned_manifold_params.mzn`**: Modified to explicitly declare `P` and `PARTITION_SCALE` as parameters, resolving previous type errors.
- **`minizinc_models/partitioned_manifold.mzn`**: Updated to correctly use `scaled_partition_values` and `int2float` for compatibility with `partitioned_manifold_params.mzn`.

These changes lay the groundwork for the `v6` model reconstruction effort, allowing for incremental testing and performance profiling of MiniZinc models.
