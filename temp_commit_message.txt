docs: Add SOP for Monotonic Epic Idea (Add-Only, Never Edit Development)

This commit introduces a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) document: `docs/sops/monotonic_epic_idea_sop.md`.

This SOP formalizes the project's foundational development philosophy, emphasizing a strictly "add-only" approach to code evolution. It outlines:
- **Core Principle:** Monotonic growth of the codebase, ensuring immutability of history, perfect traceability, and enhanced stability.
- **Procedure:** A detailed workflow for introducing new functionality, superseding existing modules, and handling "broken" modules by creating new, composable "semantic vibes" or "patches."
- **Version Control and Naming Conventions:** Guidelines for descriptive naming and comprehensive commit messages that articulate the "semantic vibe" of each change.

This SOP aims to foster a culture of deliberate, thoughtful, and transparent code evolution, ensuring that every change contributes to a clear, linear progression of the system.
