feat: Implement Makefile-based MiniZinc test runner with descriptions and emojis

This commit refactors the MiniZinc testing framework to use a Makefile-based system for improved dependency checking and test orchestration.

Key changes include:
- **`scripts/run_minizinc_test.sh`**: Updated with descriptions and emojis, and modified to copy `.dzn` files to a temporary project-local directory before execution to mitigate environment-specific permission issues.
- **`scripts/run_all_minizinc_tests.sh`**: Updated with descriptions and emojis, and refactored to delegate test execution and dependency management to the new `Makefile`.
- **`tests/minizinc_tests/Makefile`**: A new Makefile specifically for MiniZinc tests, located in `tests/minizinc_tests/`. It defines rules for running individual `.mzn` files, leveraging `make`'s dependency tracking to re-run tests only when their corresponding `.mzn` files (or their explicitly listed `.dzn` files) change. Descriptions and emojis have been added for clarity.

This change aims to provide a more robust and efficient testing workflow, despite persistent environmental permission challenges with `.dzn` files in the `Makefile`'s dependency evaluation.
