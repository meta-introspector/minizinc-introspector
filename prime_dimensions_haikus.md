## Prime Dimensions Haikus

### Prime's Essence
Number, pure and strong,
Meaning's root, a primal truth,
Base of all we build.

### Semantic Flow
Dimensions unfold,
Primes, the axes of our thought,
Knowledge, now defined.

### Fiber's Base
Bundle's ground, so firm,
Irreducible, yet vast,
Truth in every prime.
