# KitKat Break: Blueprint for Tool Documentation and Dependency Analysis

## Current State

I was in the process of outlining a blueprint for systematically documenting the project's tools and their dependencies, including analyzing overlaps in terms and concepts. This was in response to user feedback to "slow down" and delegate complex data processing to Rust tools rather than performing it directly within the LLM.

I had just completed defining the first two phases of the blueprint:

*   **Phase 1: Data Collection (Rust Tool)**: A new Rust crate (`tool_data_collector`) would be responsible for reading `Cargo.toml` files, and existing `.dir_index.json` and `.file_analysis_summary.json` files to collect raw data about each crate.
*   **Phase 2: Data Analysis & Documentation Generation (LLM)**: The LLM would then read the structured JSON output from the Rust tool, perform analysis (inferring purposes, identifying commonalities), and generate the final Markdown documentation.

## New Strategic Plan

The new strategic plan is to **implement the outlined blueprint**. This involves the following steps:

1.  **Create the `tool_data_collector` Rust crate:**
    *   Define its `Cargo.toml` with necessary dependencies (e.g., `serde`, `serde_json`, `toml`, `walkdir`).
    *   Implement the Rust logic to:
        *   Read the main `Cargo.toml` to identify all workspace member crates.
        *   For each member crate, read its `Cargo.toml` to extract package name and dependencies.
        *   Attempt to read and parse `.dir_index.json` and `.file_analysis_summary.json` files within each crate's directory (handling file not found errors gracefully).
        *   Consolidate all this raw data into a structured format (e.g., a `Vec<CrateInfo>` struct, serialized to JSON).
2.  **Execute the `tool_data_collector` crate:**
    *   Run the Rust tool to generate a JSON output file (e.g., `tool_data_collector_output.json`).
3.  **Use the LLM to analyze and generate documentation:**
    *   Read the `tool_data_collector_output.json` file.
    *   Parse the JSON content.
    *   Perform the data analysis (inferring crate purposes, identifying common dependencies and terms).
    *   Generate the final Markdown documentation (`docs/tool_inventory/tool_summaries_and_overlaps.md`), adhering to project standards (ITIL, ISO 9000, Six Sigma, C4 Model, Muse-inspired emojis).
4.  **Review and Commit:**
    *   Review the generated documentation for accuracy and clarity.
    *   Commit the new Rust tool, its output, and the generated documentation.

This approach ensures that complex data processing is handled efficiently by a dedicated Rust tool, while the LLM focuses on higher-level analysis, inference, and documentation generation, aligning with the project's principles of modularity and appropriate tool usage.
