# KitKat Break: Refactoring `rust_file_finder` and ZOS Vision Progress

## Current State (August 19, 2025)

### Overall Goal
Build a self-indexing computational system (ZOS) with numerical embeddings, formal methods, and SAT solvers, adhering to ISO 9000, GMP, Six Sigma, ITIL, C4 Model, and UML quality standards.

### Progress Made
- Created the `crates/rust_file_finder/src/lib/` directory for modularization.
- Created `crates/rust_file_finder/src/lib/types.rs` and moved `FileAnalysis`, `ProjectAnalysis`, and `FilePairSimilarity` structs into it.
- Successfully added the `GITHUB_ROOT_DIR` constant and replaced all hardcoded instances of the GitHub root path.
- Created and updated `crates/rust_file_finder/src/additional_keywords.md` with new keywords (NLP, algebra, math, proof systems, Coq, Lean4, Rust).
- Created `docs/vision/zos_self_indexing_vision.tex`, outlining the ZOS concept, its numerical representation, and future work including SAT solvers and `libminizinc`.
- Created `docs/vision/project_architecture_and_methodology.md`, detailing the architectural vision and methodological adherence to ISO 9000, GMP, Six Sigma, ITIL, C4 Model, and UML.
- Implemented the new recursive and parallel `build_directory_index` logic within `run_build_hierarchical_index_mode` in `main.rs` to generate intermediate `.dir_index.json` files and a final `hierarchical_term_index.json`.

### Pending Tasks & Immediate Focus
1.  **Fix Compilation Error**: The `cargo build` command is currently failing with a `par_iter` trait bounds error in `build_directory_index`. This is the most critical immediate task.
2.  **Complete Struct Migration**: The previous attempt to remove the struct definitions from `main.rs` and add the `mod lib;` and `use lib::types::{FileAnalysis, ProjectAnalysis, FilePairSimilarity};` statements was cancelled by the user. This needs to be completed.
3.  **Extract Utility Functions**: Move the `tokenize` function, `calculate_cosine_similarity` function, and the `STOPWORDS` constant into a new `crates/rust_file_finder/src/lib/utils.rs` file.
4.  **Abstract Project Discovery**: Create a new `crates/rust_file_finder/src/lib/discovery.rs` module to encapsulate the logic for discovering project roots (i.e., finding `Cargo.toml` files).
5.  **Update `main.rs`**: Adjust `main.rs` to import and utilize the functions and types from the newly created modules.
6.  **Test Functionality**: Once compiled, thoroughly test the `build_hierarchical_index` mode and keyword search.

### Strategic Plan: Incremental Indexing
Our strategic plan is to prioritize getting the `file_content_analyzer` to compile successfully with the new `build_directory_index` logic. Once stable, the focus will shift to optimizing the incremental indexing process, ensuring efficiency and speed for large codebases and frequent updates.

## Next Immediate Action
Fix the `par_iter` compilation error in `crates/rust_file_finder/src/main.rs` and ensure the project builds successfully.
