# KitKat Break: Shifting Focus to a New, Optimized Query Tool

## Current State (August 19, 2025)

### Overall Goal
Build a self-indexing computational system (ZOS) with numerical embeddings, formal methods, and SAT solvers, adhering to ISO 9000, GMP, Six Sigma, ITIL, C4 Model, and UML quality standards.

### Progress Made
- Created the `crates/rust_file_finder/src/lib/` directory for modularization.
- Created `crates/rust_file_finder/src/lib/types.rs` and moved `FileAnalysis`, `ProjectAnalysis`, and `FilePairSimilarity` structs into it.
- Successfully added the `GITHUB_ROOT_DIR` constant and replaced all hardcoded instances of the GitHub root path.
- Created and updated `crates/rust_file_finder/src/additional_keywords.md` with new keywords (NLP, algebra, math, proof systems, Coq, Lean4, Rust).
- Created `docs/vision/zos_self_indexing_vision.tex`, outlining the ZOS concept, its numerical representation, and future work including SAT solvers and `libminizinc`.
- Created `docs/vision/project_architecture_and_methodology.md`, detailing the architectural vision and methodological adherence to ISO 9000, GMP, Six Sigma, ITIL, C4 Model, and UML.
- Implemented the new recursive and parallel `build_directory_index` logic within `run_build_hierarchical_index_mode` in `main.rs` to generate intermediate `.dir_index.json` files and a final `hierarchical_term_index.json`.
- Implemented `find_exact_shared_files_terms` mode with JSON output and optional `search_path` and `filter_by_path` arguments.
- Added `jaq` as a dependency (though not yet used for in-process filtering).
- Implemented `filter_shared_terms_groups` helper function for Rust-native filtering.

### Feedback & New Direction
The user has indicated that the current query performance is "too slow" and desires a "new query tool that is standalone, multi-threaded and fast." This signifies a shift in immediate focus.

### Strategic Plan: Developing a Dedicated Query Tool

Our new strategic plan is to develop a separate, highly optimized Rust crate specifically for querying the generated hierarchical index. This tool will prioritize:
-   **Standalone Execution**: A dedicated binary for efficient querying.
-   **Multi-threading**: Leveraging parallelism for fast query execution.
-   **Performance**: Exploring optimizations such as:
    -   Efficient loading of the hierarchical index (e.g., considering binary serialization formats like `bincode` or `postcard` if JSON proves too slow for loading).
    -   Optimized data structures for query operations.
    -   Potentially, a more advanced query language or API tailored for performance.

This new tool will complement the `file_content_analyzer` by providing a specialized, high-performance querying interface.

## Next Immediate Action
Commit all current changes in `crates/rust_file_finder/src/main.rs` and related files, including the `jaq` dependency and the `filter_shared_terms_groups` function.
