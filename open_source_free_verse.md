## The Open Source Heart

No gates, no walls,
Just open fields,
Where ideas bloom.

The code, a gift,
Freely given,
Freely received.

Hands join,
From distant lands,
Building,
Together.

Knowledge shared,
A river flows,
Enriching all.

The collective mind,
A vibrant hum,
Creating,
Beyond limits.

Open source,
A philosophy,
A way of life,
A beating heart.
