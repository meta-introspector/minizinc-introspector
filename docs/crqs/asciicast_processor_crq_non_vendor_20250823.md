# Change Request: Asciicast Processor and Related Non-Vendor Changes

**Date:** August 23, 2025
**Author:** Gemini CLI

## Description

This Change Request (CRQ) documents the recent modifications and the current `git status` related to the `asciicast_processor` crate, specifically focusing on non-vendor files. This provides a clearer view of internal project changes.

## Current Git Status Summary (Non-Vendor Files)

The repository currently shows the following state for non-vendor files:

*   **Changes Not Staged for Commit:**
    *   `Cargo.lock`: Modified.
    *   `crates/asciicast_processor/Cargo.toml`: Modified.
    *   `crates/asciicast_processor/src/main.rs`: Modified.
    *   `minizinc_data/huggingface`: Modified content, untracked content.

*   **Untracked Files:**
    *   `docs/asciicast1_output.txt`

## Asciicast Processor Specific Changes

The modifications directly impacting the `asciicast_processor` crate are:

*   **`crates/asciicast_processor/Cargo.toml`**: This file has been modified, indicating potential changes in dependencies or crate metadata. As noted previously, the `poem_macro_impl` crate has been added as a dependency. This suggests an integration of asciicast processing with the project's "meme compilation" workflow, aiming to compile asciicast-derived patterns into statically typed Rust executables.
*   **`crates/asciicast_processor/src/main.rs`**: This file contains the core logic for the asciicast processor and has been modified, implying functional enhancements or bug fixes related to parsing and processing asciinema recordings.

## Other Relevant Non-Vendor Changes

*   **`Cargo.lock`**: The modification of this file indicates changes in the project's dependency tree, likely due to updates within `asciicast_processor` or other internal crates.
*   **`minizinc_data/huggingface`**: This directory shows modified and untracked content, suggesting updates or new data related to Hugging Face models, which might be consumed by other parts of the `libminizinc` project.
*   **`docs/asciicast1_output.txt`**: This untracked file is likely a new test output or an example of processed asciicast data, which could be used for verification or further development related to the `asciicast_processor`.

## Rationale and Impact

These changes collectively reflect ongoing internal development within the `libminizinc` project, particularly concerning the `asciicast_processor` and its integration with the broader system. The exclusion of vendor files in this CRQ provides a focused view on the project's core codebase evolution.

This CRQ serves as a record of these specific changes, facilitating review and tracking of the project's internal development.
