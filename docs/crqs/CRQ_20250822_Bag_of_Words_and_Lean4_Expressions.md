## Change Request: Bag of Words Syntax Model and Lean4-like Expressions

**Date:** 2025-08-22

**Author:** Gemini CLI Agent (Rust Edit Manager)

**Purpose:**
To propose a detailed plan and conceptual Rust code for building a "bag of words syntax model" from poem documentation, and to outline a framework for "environment binding in a lambda" and "Lean4-like expressions" based on this model.

**Background:**
Following the recent "KitKat Break" and the clarification of the Gemini CLI Agent's role as a Rust Edit Manager, the next strategic objective is to develop a system for analyzing poem content. The `fix_meme_yaml` crate addresses YAML front matter issues, serving as a prerequisite for this task. This CRQ details the subsequent steps for content analysis.

**Proposed Change:**

### 1. Building the "Bag of Words Syntax Model"

This involves extracting the textual content of poems, tokenizing it, normalizing terms, and creating a vocabulary (list of known terms) with their frequencies. This model will serve as the foundational lexical environment.

**Proposed Rust Code for Bag of Words Generation:**

```rust
use std::{fs, path::Path};
use anyhow::{Result, anyhow};
use regex::Regex;
use std::collections::{HashMap, HashSet};

/// Extracts the poem body from a markdown file with YAML front matter.
/// It assumes the front matter is delimited by '---' at the beginning and end.
fn extract_poem_body(file_path: &Path) -> Result<String> {
    let content = fs::read_to_string(file_path)?;
    let lines: Vec<&str> = content.lines().collect();

    let mut fm_end = -1;
    let mut delimiter_count = 0;
    for (i, line) in lines.iter().enumerate() {
        if line.trim() == "---" {
            delimiter_count += 1;
            if delimiter_count == 2 { // Found the end of the front matter
                fm_end = i as isize;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    if fm_end == -1 {
        // If no second delimiter is found, assume the entire file is the body (no front matter)
        // Or handle as an error if strict front matter is always expected.
        // For now, we'll treat it as an error as per fix_meme_yaml's expectation.
        return Err(anyhow!("No valid YAML front matter end delimiter found in {:?}", file_path));
    }

    let poem_body_lines = &lines[(fm_end + 1) as usize ..];
    Ok(poem_body_lines.join("\n"))
}

/// Builds a bag of words (term frequencies) from a collection of poem bodies.
/// Performs basic tokenization and lowercasing.
fn build_bag_of_words(poem_bodies: Vec<String>) -> HashMap<String, usize> {
    let mut word_counts: HashMap<String, usize> = HashMap::new();
    // Regex to find sequences of word characters (alphanumeric + underscore)
    let word_regex = Regex::new(r"\b\w+\b").unwrap();

    for body in poem_bodies {
        for mat in word_regex.find_iter(&body) {
            let word = mat.as_str().to_lowercase();
            // Simple filtering: ignore single-character words.
            // A more advanced version could include a stopword list.
            if word.len() > 1 {
                *word_counts.entry(word).or_insert(0) += 1;
            }
        }
    }
    word_counts
}

/*
// Conceptual main function demonstrating usage:
fn main() -> Result<()> {
    let poems_dir = Path::new("/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/docs/poems/");
    let mut poem_bodies = Vec::new();

    for entry in fs::read_dir(poems_dir)? {
        let entry = entry?;
        let path = entry.path();
        if path.is_file() && path.extension().map_or(false, |ext| ext == "md") {
            // Filter out non-poem markdown files (e.g., CRQs, logs, specific poems)
            if path.file_name().map_or(false, |name| {
                name == "CRQ_20250822_Fix_Agent_Sonnet.md" ||
                name == "manager_lament_20250822.md" ||
                name == "braindump_20250822.md" ||
                name == "kitkat_break_log_20250822.md"
            }) {
                continue;
            }

            match extract_poem_body(&path) {
                Ok(body) => poem_bodies.push(body),
                Err(e) => eprintln!("Error extracting poem body from {:?}: {}", path, e),
            }
        }
    }

    let bag_of_words = build_bag_of_words(poem_bodies);

    println!("--- Bag of Words (Vocabulary and Frequencies) ---");
    for (word, count) in &bag_of_words {
        println!("{}: {}", word, count);
    }
    println!("-------------------------------------------------");

    Ok(())
}
*/
```

### 2. Conceptual Framework for Lean4-like Expressions

Building upon the "bag of words" as our foundational lexical environment, we can conceptualize "environment binding in a lambda" and "Lean4-like expressions" as follows:

*   **Environment:** The `HashMap<String, usize>` generated by `build_bag_of_words` serves as our lexical environment. Each key (word) represents a known term, and its value (count) represents its frequency or presence.

*   **Lambda (Conceptual):** A "lambda" in this context could be a function that takes a simple "expression" (e.g., a string representing a phrase or a list of terms) and evaluates it against this lexical environment. For instance, a lambda could check if all terms in an expression are present in our vocabulary, or calculate a "semantic resonance score" based on term frequencies.

    ```rust
    // Conceptual Lambda: Checks if all terms in an expression are "known" (present in the vocabulary)
    fn check_expression_knowledge(expression_terms: &[String], vocabulary: &HashMap<String, usize>) -> bool {
        expression_terms.iter().all(|term| vocabulary.contains_key(term))
    }

    // Conceptual Lambda: Calculates a simple "resonance score" for an expression
    fn calculate_expression_resonance(expression_terms: &[String], vocabulary: &HashMap<String, usize>) -> usize {
        expression_terms.iter().filter_map(|term| vocabulary.get(term)).sum()
    }
    ```

*   **Lean4-like Expression (Conceptual):** This implies a desire for formal structure, type-like checking, and potentially proof-like evaluation.

    ```rust
    // Conceptual Lean4-like Expression Language
    enum LeanLikeExpression {
        CheckPresence(Vec<String>), // e.g., CheckPresence(["wisdom", "tapestry"])
        CountTerms(String),         // e.g., CountTerms("digital mind awakes")
        // Add more complex expressions like SemanticDistance(term1, term2) later
    }

    struct EvaluationContext<'a> {
        vocabulary: &'a HashMap<String, usize>,
        // Could add other contextual data like semantic embeddings here
    }

    impl LeanLikeExpression {
        fn eval(&self, context: &EvaluationContext) -> Result<serde_yaml::Value> {
            match self {
                LeanLikeExpression::CheckPresence(terms) => {
                    let all_present = terms.iter().all(|term| context.vocabulary.contains_key(term));
                    Ok(serde_yaml::to_value(all_present)?)
                },
                LeanLikeExpression::CountTerms(phrase) => {
                    let word_regex = Regex::new(r"\b\w+\b").unwrap();
                    let count = word_regex.find_iter(phrase)
                                          .filter(|mat| context.vocabulary.contains_key(&mat.as_str().to_lowercase()))
                                          .count();
                    Ok(serde_yaml::to_value(count)?)
                },
                // Implement more complex evaluation logic here
            }
        }
    }
    ```

**Rationale:**
This approach provides a structured, modular, and Rust-idiomatic way to:
- Extract and process textual data from poems.
- Build a foundational bag of words model.
- Lay the groundwork for a more advanced, formally-inspired expression evaluation system.

This aligns with the project's goals of code analysis and semantic understanding, and adheres to the Gemini CLI Agent's role by providing detailed Rust code proposals rather than direct modifications.

**Expected Outcome:**
Upon implementation, this will yield:
- A Rust binary or library capable of generating a bag of words from the project's poems.
- A clear conceptual framework for defining and evaluating Lean4-like expressions against this vocabulary.

**Next Steps:**
Review this CRQ. If approved, the next step would be to integrate the proposed Rust code into a new or existing crate within the `libminizinc` project and execute it to generate the bag of words. Further discussion would then focus on refining the `LeanLikeExpression` enum and its evaluation logic based on specific use cases.
