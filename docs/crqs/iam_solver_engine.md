## Change Request: Abstract IAM Solver Engine with Fine-Grained Access Control using MiniZinc

**Title:** Implement Abstract IAM Solver Engine with Fine-Grained Access Control using MiniZinc

**Description:**
This change proposes the development of an abstract Identity and Access Management (IAM) solver engine, inspired by AWS IAM, with the capability for fine-grained access control down to individual memory fields. The core logic of this engine will be modeled and solved using MiniZinc. This system aims to formally verify and enforce access policies for all agent actions within the `libminizinc` project, including interactions between Gemini instances, Volt-managed processes, and direct memory accesses.

**Problem Statement:**
As the `libminizinc` project evolves towards a self-aware and introspective system with multiple interacting agents (Gemini, Volt, Rust binaries), there is a critical need for a robust, verifiable, and fine-grained access control mechanism. Traditional access control lists are insufficient for dynamic, complex interactions and memory-level security. Without a formal IAM system, ensuring the trustworthiness and safety of inter-agent communication and resource access becomes challenging.

**Proposed Solution:**
Develop an abstract IAM solver engine with the following components:
1.  **Conceptual Model:** Define Principals (e.g., Gemini instances, Volt processes, Rust binaries), Resources (e.g., files, APIs, specific memory fields), Actions (e.g., `gemini:query`, `volt:run_script`, `memory:read`, `memory:write`), and Policies (Allow/Deny rules with conditions).
2.  **MiniZinc Implementation:** Model the IAM logic in MiniZinc. This model will take a request (Principal, Resource, Action) and a set of policies as input, and determine whether the action is allowed or denied based on a formal evaluation process (default deny, explicit allow, explicit deny overrides).
3.  **Fine-Grained Access Control:** The MiniZinc model will support resources as granular as individual memory fields (e.g., `memory:/project/module/struct.field`) and actions as specific as `memory:read` and `memory:write`.
4.  **Enforcement Layer (Future Integration):** While the MiniZinc model provides the reasoning, the actual enforcement will be handled by external mechanisms like eBPF, LLVM instrumentation, and Rust introspection, which will query the IAM solver (or a compiled representation of its policies) at runtime.

**Benefits:**
*   **Formal Verification:** Policies are formally defined and verifiable through MiniZinc, reducing ambiguity and errors.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Fine-grained control over memory access and inter-agent communication.
*   **Increased Trustworthiness:** A verifiable access control system contributes to the overall trustworthiness of the self-aware system.
*   **Flexibility:** Policies can be dynamically updated and reasoned about.
*   **Foundation for Self-Healing/Self-Securing:** Provides the necessary control for agents to manage their own permissions and react to security events.

**Scope:**
*   **In-Scope:**
    *   Definition of the abstract IAM conceptual model (Principals, Resources, Actions, Policies, Evaluation Logic).
    *   Development of the MiniZinc model for the IAM solver engine, supporting fine-grained resources and actions.
    *   Implementation of the `matches_pattern` predicate for wildcard and hierarchical matching in MiniZinc.
    *   Demonstration of policy evaluation for sample requests within MiniZinc.
*   **Out-of-Scope (for this CRQ, but planned for future phases):**
    *   Integration with eBPF, LLVM, or Rust introspection for runtime enforcement.
    *   Development of a policy management API or UI.
    *   Performance optimization of the MiniZinc solver for real-time enforcement (this would involve compiling policies or using specialized solvers).
    *   Complex condition evaluation within MiniZinc (e.g., time-based, context-aware conditions beyond simple boolean flags).

**Impact:**
*   **Positive:** Significantly improves the security posture and verifiability of the `libminizinc` project.
*   **Neutral:** No immediate impact on existing functionality until the enforcement layer is integrated.
*   **Negative:** Requires new development effort and understanding of MiniZinc for policy definition.

**Pre-requisites:**
*   Familiarity with MiniZinc modeling.
*   Understanding of IAM concepts.

**Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Define MiniZinc Data Structures:**
    *   Create `set of string: PRINCIPALS;`, `set of string: RESOURCES;`, `set of string: ACTIONS;`.
    *   Define `enum Effect = {Allow, Deny};`.
    *   Define the `PolicyStatement` record with `effect`, `principals`, `actions`, `resources`, and `condition_met`.
    *   Declare `array[int] of PolicyStatement: policies;`.

2.  **Implement `matches_pattern` Predicate:**
    *   Write the MiniZinc predicate `matches_pattern(string: target, set of string: patterns)` to handle wildcard (`*`) and hierarchical matching (e.g., `prefix/*`).

3.  **Implement `matches_statement` Predicate:**
    *   Write the MiniZinc predicate `matches_statement(string: principal, string: action, string: resource, PolicyStatement: statement)` using `matches_pattern`.

4.  **Implement Core Evaluation Logic:**
    *   Declare input variables: `string: requested_principal;`, `string: requested_resource;`, `string: requested_action;`.
    *   Declare decision variable: `bool: is_allowed;`.
    *   Implement constraints for `has_matching_allow` and `has_matching_deny` based on `matches_statement` and `condition_met`.
    *   Implement the final `is_allowed` constraint: `is_allowed = has_matching_allow /\ not has_matching_deny;`.

5.  **Create Sample Policies and Requests:**
    *   Populate the `policies` array with example IAM rules, including fine-grained memory access policies.
    *   Define sample `requested_principal`, `requested_resource`, and `requested_action` inputs to test various scenarios (allowed, denied by default, denied by explicit deny, allowed by explicit allow).

6.  **Add Solve Statement:**
    *   `solve satisfy;` to find if the request is allowed.

**Verification Plan:**
1.  **Unit Testing with MiniZinc:**
    *   For each sample request, run the MiniZinc model and verify that the `is_allowed` variable correctly reflects the expected outcome (true for allowed, false for denied).
    *   Test edge cases: wildcards, specific denies, overlapping policies.
2.  **Policy Conflict Detection (Future):** The MiniZinc model can be extended to identify conflicting policies (e.g., a policy that allows and another that denies the exact same request without a clear override).

**Rollback Plan:**
*   This change introduces a new MiniZinc model and does not modify existing code. Rollback involves simply discarding the new MiniZinc files.
