## CRQ-20250821-001: Incremental Word Embedding Optimization for MiniZinc Inference

### Description:
This Change Request proposes the implementation of an incremental word embedding optimization process. The goal is to refine 8D word embeddings generated from project documentation by iteratively solving MiniZinc models on data chunks. This approach aims to improve performance and scalability for large datasets by leveraging previously optimized embeddings as fixed parameters for subsequent iterations.

### Rationale:
Current word embedding generation and optimization for MiniZinc inference can be computationally intensive and slow for the entire dataset. An incremental approach will allow for:
*   **Improved Performance:** By processing data in smaller chunks and warm-starting the solver with prior optimizations.
*   **Scalability:** Enabling the system to handle larger codebases and documentation sets more efficiently.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Providing a mechanism for continuous improvement of embedding quality over time.

### Expected Outcomes:
*   Modification of `doc_to_minizinc_data` to support input of previous optimized embeddings.
*   Development of an orchestration script (`run_incremental_embedding_optimization.sh`) to manage the iterative MiniZinc solving process.
*   Enhanced performance and scalability of the word embedding optimization pipeline.
*   A more robust and adaptable system for generating and refining semantic embeddings.
