## Change Request: Emacs-Gemini Interface (Detailed Implementation Plan)

**Title:** Implement Emacs-Gemini Interface for Programmatic Control

**Description:**
This change details the implementation plan for the Emacs-Gemini Interface, building upon the previously defined architectural design. The goal is to enable the Gemini CLI agent to programmatically control and interact with Emacs instances running within `tmux` sessions via a Rust intermediary. This will allow Gemini to leverage Emacs's powerful text editing, code manipulation, and introspection capabilities for automated tasks and enhanced development workflows.

**Problem Statement:**
While Gemini possesses strong reasoning and code generation abilities, direct interaction with a rich text editor like Emacs is currently limited. Automating complex code modifications, refactoring, or leveraging Emacs's specialized modes (e.g., Org-mode, Magit) requires a robust, programmatic interface. Without this, Gemini's ability to directly manipulate and analyze code within the developer's preferred environment is constrained.

**Proposed Solution:**
Implement the Emacs-Gemini Interface through the following key components:
1.  **`zos-stage-session-manager` Extension:** Enhance `zos-stage-session-manager` to specifically launch and manage Emacs instances within `tmux` panes, including passing initial configurations or files.
2.  **Rust-Emacs Bridge (New Crate):** Develop a dedicated Rust crate (e.g., `crates/emacs-bridge`) that acts as the primary communication channel. This bridge will:
    *   Utilize `tmux_interface` to send Emacs Lisp (Elisp) commands to target Emacs panes.
    *   Capture and parse output from Emacs, including results of Elisp evaluation and buffer contents.
    *   Handle asynchronous communication and potential errors.
3.  **Standardized Elisp Wrappers:** Define a set of standardized Elisp functions within Emacs that expose core functionalities (e.g., `find-file`, `save-buffer`, `eval-buffer`, `insert-string`, `get-buffer-string`). These wrappers will ensure consistent input/output formats for programmatic access.
4.  **Gemini-Emacs API (Conceptual):** Within Gemini's reasoning layer, define a conceptual API for interacting with Emacs, translating high-level requests into specific Elisp commands to be executed via the Rust-Emacs Bridge.

**Benefits:**
*   **Automated Code Manipulation:** Enables Gemini to perform complex refactoring, code generation, and file management directly within Emacs.
*   **Enhanced Development Workflow:** Integrates AI capabilities seamlessly into the developer's existing Emacs-centric workflow.
*   **Leverage Emacs Ecosystem:** Allows Gemini to utilize Emacs's vast array of modes and packages for specialized tasks.
*   **Increased Efficiency:** Automates repetitive or complex editing tasks, freeing up human developers.

**Scope:**
*   **In-Scope:**
    *   Extension of `zos-stage-session-manager` to launch Emacs in a `tmux` pane.
    *   Creation of a new Rust crate (`crates/emacs-bridge`) for the Rust-Emacs Bridge.
    *   Implementation of basic `send_command` and `capture_output` functionalities in the Rust-Emacs Bridge using `tmux_interface`.
    *   Definition and implementation of a few sample Elisp wrappers for common Emacs functions (e.g., `find-file`, `insert-string`, `save-buffer`).
    *   Demonstration of Gemini (via the Rust bridge) opening a file, inserting text, and saving it in Emacs.
*   **Out-of-Scope (for this CRQ, but planned for future phases):**
    *   Comprehensive Elisp wrapper library for all Emacs functions.
    *   Advanced error recovery and debugging within the Emacs-Gemini interaction.
    *   Real-time, bidirectional communication channels beyond simple command-response.
    *   Integration with the IAM solver engine for Emacs-level access control.
    *   Complex UI interactions within Emacs (e.g., navigating menus, interacting with dialogs).

**Impact:**
*   **Positive:** Significantly enhances Gemini's ability to interact with and modify code and text, improving its utility as a development assistant.
*   **Neutral:** No direct impact on existing non-Emacs functionalities.
*   **Negative:** Requires new development effort and introduces a dependency on Emacs and `tmux`.

**Pre-requisites:**
*   `zos-stage-session-manager` with `tmux_interface` integration.
*   Emacs must be installed and accessible on the system.
*   Familiarity with Emacs Lisp.

**Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Extend `zos-stage-session-manager`:**
    *   Add a new subcommand or option to `LaunchArgs` to launch Emacs in a `tmux` pane.
    *   Ensure Emacs is launched in a non-GUI, terminal-friendly mode (e.g., `emacs -nw`).

2.  **Create `crates/emacs-bridge` Subcrate:**
    *   Create the directory `crates/emacs-bridge`.
    *   Create `crates/emacs-bridge/Cargo.toml` and add `tmux_interface` and other necessary dependencies.
    *   Add `crates/emacs-bridge` to the root `Cargo.toml` members.

3.  **Implement Rust-Emacs Bridge Core:**
    *   In `crates/emacs-bridge/src/lib.rs`, define functions to:
        *   Connect to a `tmux` session/pane.
        *   Send Elisp commands using `tmux_interface::send_keys`.
        *   Capture output from the `tmux` pane (e.g., using `tmux capture-pane`).

4.  **Define Sample Elisp Wrappers:**
    *   Create a sample `.el` file (e.g., `emacs_gemini_wrappers.el`) with functions like:
        *   `(gemini-find-file filename)`
        *   `(gemini-insert-string text)`
        *   `(gemini-save-buffer)`
        *   `(gemini-eval-lisp code)`
    *   Ensure these wrappers return predictable output for parsing by the Rust bridge.

5.  **Demonstrate End-to-End Workflow:**
    *   Launch Emacs via `zos-stage-session-manager`.
    *   From a test script (or a simulated Gemini interaction), use the Rust-Emacs Bridge to:
        *   Open a file in Emacs.
        *   Insert some text.
        *   Save the buffer.
        *   Evaluate a simple Elisp expression and capture its result.

**Verification Plan:**
1.  **Build and Run:** Successfully build and run `zos-stage-session-manager` and `crates/emacs-bridge`.
2.  **Emacs Launch:** Verify that Emacs is correctly launched in a `tmux` pane.
3.  **Command Execution:** Confirm that Elisp commands sent via the Rust bridge are executed in Emacs.
4.  **Output Capture:** Verify that output from Emacs (e.g., `eval-lisp` results, buffer contents) is correctly captured by the Rust bridge.
5.  **File Manipulation:** Test opening, modifying, and saving files in Emacs via the interface.

**Rollback Plan:**
*   This change introduces new components and modifies an existing one. Rollback involves reverting changes to `zos-stage-session-manager/src/main.rs` and its `Cargo.toml`, and removing the `crates/emacs-bridge` directory and its entry from the root `Cargo.toml`.
