### Change Request (CRQ)

**1. CRQ Identification**

*   **CRQ ID:** `CRQ-20250820-001`
*   **Title:** Implement Incremental Indexing, Work Estimation, and Profiling for the Code Analyzer
*   **Requester:** User
*   **Date of Request:** 2025-08-20

**2. Change Description**

The current code analysis and indexing process is a full, monolithic operation. Every time it runs, it re-analyzes all files, which is inefficient and time-consuming, especially as the codebase grows. There is no way to estimate the time required for the indexing process, and there is no mechanism to identify performance bottlenecks.

This change proposes to implement the following enhancements:

*   **Incremental Indexing:** The indexing process will be modified to only update the index with the changes since the last run. This will significantly reduce the time required for subsequent indexing operations.
*   **Work Estimation:** A new "estimate" mode will be added to the tool to provide a report of the work to be done, including a list of new, modified, and deleted files, and an estimated time to complete the indexing process.
*   **Profiling and Bottleneck Analysis:** The tool will be instrumented with a profiler to identify performance bottlenecks in the indexing process. This will enable targeted optimizations to improve performance.

**3. Business Justification**

*   **Improved Efficiency:** Incremental indexing will dramatically reduce the time required to keep the code index up-to-date, improving developer productivity.
*   **Predictability:** The work estimation feature will provide predictability to the indexing process, allowing developers to plan their work more effectively.
*   **Performance Optimization:** The profiling and bottleneck analysis will enable targeted performance optimizations, making the tool faster and more scalable.
*   **Alignment with Best Practices:** This change aligns with software engineering best practices for building and maintaining large-scale software systems.

**4. Scope**

This change will affect the following components:

*   `file_content_analyzer` crate: The core logic of this crate will be modified to implement the new features.
*   `Cargo.toml`: New dependencies (e.g., for profiling) will be added.

**5. Risk Assessment**

*   **Low Risk:** The proposed changes are well-understood and will be implemented in a way that minimizes the risk of regressions. The existing functionality will be preserved, and the new features will be added in a modular and non-intrusive way.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   The changes will be developed on a separate feature branch.
    *   Thorough testing will be performed to ensure that the new features work as expected and that no regressions are introduced.
    *   The existing caching mechanism will be preserved as a fallback.

**6. Implementation Plan**

**Phase 1: Incremental Indexing and Work Estimation**

1.  **Analyze the existing `file_content_analyzer`:** Re-read the `file_content_analyzer/src/main.rs` file to fully understand the current implementation.
2.  **Introduce a "Dry Run" or "Estimate" Mode:** Add a new mode (`--mode estimate`) to the `file_content_analyzer` tool to report the work to be done and estimate the time required.
3.  **Implement Incremental Indexing:** Modify the `full_analysis` and `build_hierarchical_index` modes to be truly incremental, using a persistent cache to store file metadata and only re-processing changed files.

**Phase 2: Profiling and Bottleneck Analysis**

1.  **Integrate a Profiling Crate:** Add a profiling crate (e.g., `puffin`) to the `file_content_analyzer`.
2.  **Add Profiling Scopes:** Add profiling scopes to the code to measure the time taken by different parts of the indexing process.
3.  **Generate Profiling Reports:** Add a new command-line flag (`--generate-profile-report`) to enable the profiler and generate a report.

**Phase 3: Continuous Improvement**

1.  **Analyze Profiling Reports:** Analyze the profiling reports to identify the most time-consuming parts of the indexing process.
2.  **Optimize Bottlenecks:** Implement optimizations to address the identified bottlenecks.
3.  **Iterate:** Repeat the profiling and optimization process until the performance is satisfactory.

**7. Test Plan**

*   **Unit Tests:** New unit tests will be added to test the incremental indexing logic and the work estimation feature.
*   **Integration Tests:** New integration tests will be added to test the new command-line modes and the profiling feature.
*   **Manual Testing:** Manual testing will be performed to verify that the new features work as expected and that the user experience is satisfactory.

**8. Rollback Plan**

In the unlikely event of a major issue, the changes can be rolled back by reverting the commits on the feature branch.

**9. Communication Plan**

*   The user will be kept informed of the progress of the implementation.
*   The new features will be documented in the `README.md` file and in the tool's help messages.
