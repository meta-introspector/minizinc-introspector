## Change Request (CRQ): Implement Rust-Native Broadcast Functions for Multi-Platform Live Streaming

**Title:** Implement Rust-Native Broadcast Functions for Multi-Platform Live Streaming

**Description:**
Develop a Rust-based module or application to enable live video and audio broadcasting to multiple streaming platforms (e.g., Twitter, Rumble, Telegram, Twitch) directly from a Rust environment, mimicking core functionalities of OBS Studio. This aims to integrate streaming capabilities natively within our Rust ecosystem, reducing external dependencies and enhancing control.

**Justification/Motivation:**
*   **Native Integration:** Reduce reliance on external applications like OBS Studio, allowing for deeper integration and automation within our Rust-based tools.
*   **Performance & Control:** Leverage Rust's performance characteristics for efficient media processing and gain fine-grained control over streaming pipelines.
*   **Customization:** Enable highly customized streaming workflows and dynamic content generation directly from Rust applications.
*   **Security:** Potentially enhance security by controlling the entire streaming stack.

**Scope:**
*   **In-Scope:**
    *   Capture of screen/window content (video) and system audio (audio).
    *   Encoding of video (e.g., H.264/H.265) and audio (e.g., AAC).
    *   RTMP/RTMPS streaming protocol implementation for common platforms.
    *   Simultaneous broadcasting to multiple configured platforms.
    *   Basic overlay capabilities (text, simple images).
*   **Out-of-Scope (Initial Phase):**
    *   Advanced scene composition (complex transitions, filters).
    *   Virtual camera/audio device creation.
    *   Direct integration with platform-specific APIs beyond RTMP/RTMPS.
    *   Complex audio mixing.

**High-Level Plan/Approach:**
1.  **Research & Library Evaluation:** Investigate existing Rust crates for media processing (e.g., `gstreamer-rs` bindings, `ffmpeg-next`), audio/video encoding, and network streaming protocols.
2.  **FFI for OBS Core (Optional/Consideration):** Explore the feasibility of FFI bindings to OBS Studio's core libraries for leveraging its robust capabilities, if a purely native Rust solution proves too complex or time-consuming initially.
3.  **Modular Design:** Design the solution as a set of modular crates (e.g., `minizinc-stream-capture`, `minizinc-media-encode`, `minizinc-rtmp-client`).
4.  **Proof of Concept:** Develop a minimal PoC for single-platform streaming (e.g., to Twitch).
5.  **Multi-Platform Extension:** Extend the PoC to support simultaneous multi-platform broadcasting.

**Dependencies/Prerequisites:**
*   Stable Rust toolchain.
*   Understanding of media encoding standards (H.264, AAC).
*   Knowledge of RTMP/RTMPS protocols.
*   (Potentially) System-level access for screen/audio capture.

**Success Criteria:**
*   Successful compilation and execution of the Rust broadcast application.
*   Ability to stream live video and audio to at least two target platforms simultaneously.
*   Achieve acceptable latency and stream quality comparable to basic OBS Studio output.
*   Demonstrate basic overlay functionality.
