## Asciicast Processor Specific Changes

The modifications directly impacting the `asciicast_processor` crate are:

*   **`crates/asciicast_processor/Cargo.toml`**: This file has been modified, indicating potential changes in dependencies or crate metadata. Notably, the `poem_macro_impl` crate has been added as a dependency. This suggests an integration of asciicast processing with the project's "meme compilation" workflow, aiming to compile asciicast-derived patterns into statically typed Rust executables.
*   **`crates/asciicast_processor/src/main.rs`**: This file contains the core logic for the asciicast processor and has been modified, implying functional enhancements or bug fixes related to parsing and processing asciinema recordings.

## Rationale and Impact

These changes collectively suggest a focused effort to enhance the `asciicast_processor`'s capabilities. The integration with `poem_macro_impl` is a significant step towards leveraging asciicast content as a source for "memes" that can be compiled and statically typed within the Rust ecosystem. The untracked `docs/asciicast1_output.txt` likely represents a new test output or an example of processed asciicast data, which could be used for verification or further development.

This CRQ serves as a record of these changes, facilitating review and tracking of the `asciicast_processor`'s evolution within the project.
