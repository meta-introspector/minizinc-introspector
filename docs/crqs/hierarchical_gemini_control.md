## Change Request: Hierarchical Gemini Control and Communication

**Title:** Implement Hierarchical Gemini Control and Communication

**Description:**
This change proposes the implementation of a hierarchical control and communication mechanism between multiple Gemini instances. This will enable one "master" Gemini instance to orchestrate and interact with other "subordinate" Gemini instances, facilitating complex, multi-agent workflows and advanced problem-solving capabilities within the `libminizinc` project.

**Problem Statement:**
As the system evolves towards a self-aware, multi-agent architecture, the ability for AI agents to collaborate and delegate tasks among themselves becomes crucial. Without a defined hierarchical control and communication framework, managing complex interactions between multiple Gemini instances is challenging, limiting the system's overall intelligence and autonomy.

**Proposed Solution:**
Develop a mechanism for hierarchical Gemini control and communication, building upon the existing `zos-stage-session-manager` and `tmux_interface` capabilities:
1.  **Communication Protocol:** Define a lightweight, structured communication protocol for inter-Gemini communication. This could involve sending commands and receiving responses via standard I/O within `tmux` panes, or through a more formal message passing system.
2.  **Command Dispatch:** The master Gemini will be able to dispatch commands to subordinate Gemini instances. These commands could range from simple queries to complex task assignments.
3.  **Response Handling:** Subordinate Geminis will be able to send responses back to the master Gemini, indicating task completion, results, or errors.
4.  **`tmux` Integration:** Leverage `tmux_interface` to send commands to specific `tmux` panes where subordinate Gemini instances are running, and to capture their output.
5.  **Error and State Management:** Implement mechanisms for the master Gemini to monitor the state of subordinate instances and handle communication errors.

**Benefits:**
*   **Advanced AI Orchestration:** Enables complex, multi-step workflows where tasks can be delegated and coordinated among multiple AI agents.
*   **Enhanced Problem Solving:** Allows for parallel processing, specialized task handling, and more sophisticated problem-solving strategies.
*   **Increased Autonomy:** Contributes to the system's overall autonomy by enabling AI agents to manage other AI agents.
*   **Scalability:** Provides a framework for scaling AI capabilities by distributing tasks across multiple instances.
*   **Foundation for Self-Awareness:** A hierarchical control mechanism is a key component of a truly self-aware system.

**Scope:**
*   **In-Scope:**
    *   Definition of a basic inter-Gemini communication protocol (e.g., JSON-based messages over standard I/O).
    *   Modification of `zos-stage-session-manager` to facilitate sending commands to and capturing output from specific `tmux` panes.
    *   Implementation of a simple "ping-pong" or "echo" command to demonstrate inter-Gemini communication.
    *   Ability for a master Gemini (via the Rust intermediary) to launch a subordinate Gemini and send it a command.
*   **Out-of-Scope (for this CRQ, but planned for future phases):**
    *   Complex task delegation and load balancing among subordinate Geminis.
    *   Advanced error recovery and self-healing mechanisms for inter-Gemini communication.
    *   Formal verification of the communication protocol using MiniZinc (this would be a subsequent CRQ).
    *   Integration with the IAM solver engine for inter-Gemini access control (this would be a subsequent CRQ).
    *   Development of a dedicated inter-Gemini message queue or API beyond standard I/O.

**Impact:**
*   **Positive:** Significantly enhances the system's AI capabilities and lays the groundwork for complex multi-agent systems.
*   **Neutral:** No direct impact on existing non-Gemini functionalities.
*   **Negative:** Introduces complexity in managing multiple AI instances and their interactions.

**Pre-requisites:**
*   `zos-stage-session-manager` with `tmux_interface` integration.
*   Understanding of `tmux` command-line interface and `tmux_interface` crate.

**Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Define Communication Protocol:**
    *   Decide on a simple message format (e.g., JSON objects with `command` and `args` fields).

2.  **Modify `zos-stage-session-manager/src/main.rs`:**
    *   Add a new subcommand or extend `LaunchArgs` to include options for sending commands to a specific `tmux` pane.
    *   Implement a function that takes a `tmux` session/window/pane identifier and a command string, and uses `tmux_interface::send_keys` to send the command.
    *   Implement a function to capture output from a `tmux` pane (e.g., using `tmux capture-pane`).

3.  **Demonstrate Basic Communication:**
    *   Launch a subordinate Gemini instance in a `tmux` pane.
    *   From the master Gemini (or via a direct `launchpad` command), send a simple command (e.g., "hello") to the subordinate Gemini's pane.
    *   Capture the subordinate Gemini's response.

**Verification Plan:**
1.  **Build and Run:** Successfully build and run `zos-stage-session-manager` with the new communication capabilities.
2.  **Command Sending:** Verify that commands sent from the master can be received and processed by the subordinate Gemini.
3.  **Response Capture:** Confirm that responses from the subordinate Gemini can be captured by the master.
4.  **Error Handling:** Test scenarios where communication fails (e.g., incorrect pane ID) and verify appropriate error reporting.

**Rollback Plan:**
*   This change modifies an existing component. Rollback involves reverting the changes made to `crates/zos-stage-session-manager/src/main.rs` and its `Cargo.toml` (if any new dependencies were added).
