## Change Request: Gemini Agent Decomposition and Modularization

**Title:** Gemini Agent Decomposition and Modularization

**Description:**
This change proposes the decomposition of the monolithic Gemini CLI agent into smaller, more modular, and reusable components. This refactoring aims to enhance the system's flexibility, scalability, and maintainability, allowing for more fine-grained control over Gemini's capabilities and facilitating its integration into various parts of the `libminizinc` project.

**Problem Statement:**
As the `libminizinc` project evolves towards a multi-agent, self-aware system, a monolithic Gemini agent can become a bottleneck. A single, large agent limits the ability to:
*   Deploy specific Gemini functionalities independently.
*   Control access to individual capabilities via IAM rules.
*   Scale specific functionalities without scaling the entire agent.
*   Facilitate inter-agent communication and collaboration at a granular level.
*   Integrate Gemini's core reasoning into other Rust components (e.g., `libminizinc` FFI).

**Proposed Solution:**
Decompose the Gemini CLI agent into a set of distinct, modular Rust crates or modules, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities. This decomposition will follow principles of separation of concerns and high cohesion. Potential modules include:
1.  **Core Reasoning Engine:** Handling fundamental LLM interactions, prompt management, and response parsing.
2.  **Tool Orchestration:** Managing the invocation and integration of external tools (e.g., `run_shell_command`, `read_file`, `web_fetch`).
3.  **Memory Management:** Handling long-term memory, context retrieval, and memory persistence.
4.  **Code Generation/Manipulation:** Specialized modules for generating, analyzing, and modifying code.
5.  **Communication Interface:** Providing a standardized API for other agents or components to interact with Gemini's functionalities.

**Benefits:**
*   **Enhanced Modularity:** Enables independent development, testing, and deployment of Gemini's capabilities.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Allows for precise application of IAM rules to individual Gemini functionalities.
*   **Improved Scalability:** Specific components can be scaled independently based on demand.
*   **Increased Reusability:** Core Gemini functionalities can be reused across different parts of the `libminizinc` project.
*   **Facilitates Inter-Agent Communication:** Simplifies the integration of Gemini's capabilities into multi-agent workflows.
*   **Adherence to Standards:** Aligns with modular design principles (C4 model) and promotes better code organization.

**Scope:**
*   **In-Scope:**
    *   Analysis of the existing Gemini CLI agent's functionalities for logical decomposition.
    *   Definition of clear interfaces and APIs for each new Gemini module.
    *   Creation of new Rust crates or modules for the decomposed components.
    *   Refactoring of the existing Gemini CLI agent to utilize these new modules.
*   **Out-of-Scope (for this CRQ, but planned for future phases):**
    *   Full implementation of all decomposed modules (initial focus on architectural definition and basic refactoring).
    *   Integration with the IAM solver engine for fine-grained access control to these new modules (this will be a subsequent CRQ).
    *   Performance optimization of the decomposed modules.
    *   Deployment strategies for distributed Gemini components.

**Impact:**
*   **Positive:** Significantly improves the architectural flexibility and extensibility of the Gemini agent.
*   **Neutral:** No immediate impact on end-user functionality during the initial decomposition phase.
*   **Negative:** Requires significant refactoring effort and careful management of dependencies.

**Pre-requisites:**
*   Deep understanding of the existing Gemini CLI agent's codebase.
*   Familiarity with Rust module and crate organization.

**Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Functional Analysis:**
    *   Identify distinct functional areas within the current Gemini CLI agent.
    *   Map these areas to potential new modules/crates.

2.  **Interface Definition:**
    *   For each identified module, define clear input/output interfaces (APIs).

3.  **New Crate/Module Creation:**
    *   Create new Rust crates or modules for the initial set of decomposed components (e.g., `crates/gemini-core-reasoning`, `crates/gemini-tool-orchestration`).
    *   Add these new crates to the root `Cargo.toml` members.

4.  **Refactoring and Migration:**
    *   Gradually migrate existing functionalities from the monolithic Gemini agent into their respective new modules.
    *   Update the main Gemini CLI agent to consume functionalities from these new modules.

**Verification Plan:**
1.  **Build and Run:** Successfully build and run the refactored Gemini CLI agent.
2.  **Functional Equivalence:** Verify that all existing functionalities of the Gemini CLI agent work as expected after decomposition.
3.  **Module Isolation:** Ensure that modules are loosely coupled and adhere to their defined interfaces.
4.  **Unit/Integration Tests:** Develop and run tests for each new module and for the integrated system.

**Rollback Plan:**
*   This change involves significant refactoring. Rollback would involve reverting the changes made to the Gemini agent's codebase and removing any newly created modules/crates. This would be a complex rollback, emphasizing the need for careful planning and incremental development.
