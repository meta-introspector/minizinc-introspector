## Change Request: TUI Component Decomposition and Rust Reusability

**Title:** TUI Component Decomposition and Rust Reusability

**Description:**
This change proposes the decomposition of Terminal User Interface (TUI) components within the `libminizinc` project into reusable Rust modules. The goal is to enable programmatic access and integration of TUI elements into various Rust applications, fostering greater flexibility, consistency, and reusability across the system.

**Problem Statement:**
As the project develops more TUIs (e.g., for process monitoring, session management), a monolithic TUI implementation for each application can lead to code duplication, inconsistent user experiences, and difficulty in programmatic control. Without a modular approach, integrating TUI functionalities into other Rust components (e.g., for AI-driven interaction or custom displays) becomes challenging.

**Proposed Solution:**
Decompose TUI functionalities into distinct, reusable Rust crates or modules. These modules will provide programmatic interfaces for rendering and interacting with TUI elements. Potential modules include:
1.  **TUI Core Utilities:** Basic building blocks for TUI applications (e.g., drawing primitives, event handling, layout management).
2.  **Process Display Components:** Reusable widgets or functions for displaying process lists, individual process details, and resource usage.
3.  **Session Management Components:** Reusable elements for displaying `tmux` sessions, windows, and panes, and for interacting with them.
4.  **Input/Output Handlers:** Standardized modules for handling user input and displaying output within a TUI context.

**Benefits:**
*   **Increased Reusability:** TUI components can be easily integrated into multiple Rust applications, reducing code duplication.
*   **Consistent User Experience:** Promotes a unified look and feel across different TUIs within the project.
*   **Programmatic Control:** Enables AI agents (like Gemini) to programmatically interact with and manipulate TUI elements, facilitating AI-human collaboration.
*   **Enhanced Modularity:** Improves code organization and maintainability by separating TUI logic from application logic.
*   **Facilitates Testing:** Individual TUI components can be tested in isolation.

**Scope:**
*   **In-Scope:**
    *   Analysis of existing or planned TUI functionalities (e.g., `zos-stage-process-monitor`) for decomposition.
    *   Definition of clear interfaces and APIs for reusable TUI components.
    *   Creation of new Rust crates or modules for the decomposed TUI components.
    *   Refactoring of existing TUI implementations (or initial development of new ones) to utilize these new modules.
*   **Out-of-Scope (for this CRQ, but planned for future phases):**
    *   Full implementation of all decomposed TUI components (initial focus on architectural definition and basic refactoring).
    *   Advanced graphical rendering or complex animation within TUIs.
    *   Integration with the IAM solver engine for fine-grained access control to TUI elements.

**Impact:**
*   **Positive:** Significantly improves the flexibility, reusability, and maintainability of TUI development within the project.
*   **Neutral:** No immediate impact on end-user functionality during the initial decomposition phase.
*   **Negative:** Requires refactoring effort and careful design of reusable components.

**Pre-requisites:**
*   Familiarity with Rust TUI libraries (e.g., `ratatui`, `crossterm`).
*   Understanding of TUI design patterns.

**Implementation Plan:**

1.  **Functional Analysis of TUIs:**
    *   Identify common TUI elements and functionalities across planned or existing TUIs.
    *   Determine logical boundaries for decomposition into reusable components.

2.  **Interface Definition:**
    *   Define clear input/output interfaces (APIs) for each reusable TUI component.

3.  **New Crate/Module Creation:**
    *   Create new Rust crates or modules for the decomposed TUI components (e.g., `crates/tui-widgets`, `crates/tui-process-display`).
    *   Add these new crates to the root `Cargo.toml` members.

4.  **Refactoring and Integration:**
    *   Migrate existing TUI code (or develop new TUIs) to utilize these new reusable components.
    *   Ensure programmatic access to TUI elements for AI interaction.

**Verification Plan:**
1.  **Build and Run:** Successfully build and run applications utilizing the decomposed TUI components.
2.  **Functional Equivalence:** Verify that TUIs built with decomposed components function identically to their monolithic counterparts (if applicable).
3.  **Component Reusability:** Demonstrate the successful reuse of a TUI component in at least two different contexts or applications.
4.  **Programmatic Control:** Test basic programmatic interaction with TUI elements via Rust code.

**Rollback Plan:**
*   This change involves significant refactoring. Rollback would involve reverting the changes made to TUI implementations and removing any newly created TUI component modules/crates. This would be a complex rollback, emphasizing the need for careful planning and incremental development.
