## Recent Build Fixes and `gemini_utils` Refinement

This document summarizes the recent changes made to the `libminizinc` project, primarily focusing on resolving compilation errors and refining the `gemini_utils` procedural macro.

### Commit `5ae926712`
**Message:** `Fix: Apply cargo fix suggestions to gemini_utils`
**Details:** This commit reflects the automatic fix applied by `cargo fix --lib -p gemini_utils`. It removed the unused import `process_char_for_emojis` from `crates/gemini_utils/src/lib.rs`.

### Commit `3404b5475`
**Message:** `Fix: Resolve compilation errors in gemini_utils and asciicast_processor`
**Details:** This was a crucial commit that addressed several compilation blockers:
- **`crates/asciicast_processor/src/main.rs`:** Added `use std::io::BufRead;` to resolve the `no method named `lines` found for struct `BufReader`` error, enabling proper line-by-line reading of files.
- **`crates/gemini_utils/src/lib.rs`:** Fixed an `unexpected closing delimiter: `}` error by removing an extra closing brace within the `gemini_eprintln!` macro's implementation. This commit also included significant refactoring of the macro's internal logic for parsing and handling `::keyword::` and `:key:` patterns, which was a key step in improving its robustness and adherence to "kantspel" principles.
- **`crates/gemini_utils_test/src/lib.rs`:** Corrected a `Named argument 'limit' is not used in the format string` error by changing `::brickwall::` to `:limit:` in a `gemini_eprintln!` call, ensuring the named argument was correctly mapped to a placeholder.

### Commit `fe476f86b`
**Message:** `wip`
**Details:** This commit represents a work-in-progress state that laid the groundwork for the subsequent fixes and refinements:
- **`crates/asciicast_processor/src/main.rs`:** Began integrating `gemini_eprintln!` into the `asciicast_processor` by replacing standard `eprintln!` calls. This involved updating format strings to use `::sparkles::` and `:limit:` placeholders.
- **`crates/gemini_utils/src/string_processor/mod.rs`:** Substantially modified the `EMOJIS` HashMap. New mappings were introduced (e.g., `::variable::`, `:::brick:::`, `::newline::`, `::sparkles::`) to enhance the `gemini_eprintln!` macro's ability to translate keywords and emojis into Rust formatting characters, aligning with the "kantspel" principles for consistent character handling.
- **`crates/gemini_utils_test/src/lib.rs`:** Initial adjustment of a `gemini_eprintln!` call's format string, which was further refined in the next commit.

### Overall Progress

The recent efforts have successfully resolved critical compilation errors across `gemini_utils` and `asciicast_processor`, making the project buildable again. A significant portion of the work involved refining the `gemini_eprintln!` procedural macro to improve its parsing logic and expand its support for "kantspel"-compliant character and keyword transformations. The integration of `gemini_eprintln!` into `asciicast_processor` is also underway, aiming to leverage its enhanced logging capabilities.

### Next Steps

Further investigation is needed to understand the context of "deleted code from cast 21". This will likely involve analyzing the content of `docs/asciicast21.cast` using the `asciicast_processor` tool to identify any filtered or excluded output.
