## Review of `test_03_unwrap_model.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This test verifies that a successfully parsed MiniZinc model (represented by a `Result<MiniZincModel, Error>`) can be safely unwrapped to obtain the `MiniZincModel` object. This is a basic sanity check for the `parse_string` function's return value.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `use crate::tests::tests::GLOBAL_MINIZINC_ENV`: Accesses the global MiniZinc environment.
    *   `env.parse_string(model_code)`: Calls the `parse_string` method, which performs the FFI interaction to parse the model.
    *   `assert!(model.is_ok())`: Asserts that the parsing was successful.
    *   `let _model_obj = model.unwrap()`: The core of the test, ensuring that `unwrap()` does not panic when `is_ok()` is true.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Indirectly tests the FFI by ensuring the `parse_string` function returns a valid `Result` that can be unwrapped. This is crucial for the Rust side to correctly handle the FFI's output.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Tests the successful parsing of a minimal MiniZinc model.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Reliability:** This test contributes to the overall reliability of the semantic embedding pipeline. If the `Result` from parsing cannot be reliably unwrapped, it would break subsequent steps in the "big idea."
        *   **Error Handling:** While simple, it implicitly tests that the `parse_string` function correctly distinguishes between successful parsing and errors.

*   **Integration into Rust Busy Box (`ragit-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** This test would fall under `ragit-bootstrap test rust-ffi`.
    *   **Internal Module:** The `parse_string` functionality is part of the `minizinc_ffi` crate's `environment` module. The test itself would be called by the `commands/test.rs` module.

This test is a fundamental check for the correct handling of FFI return values.
