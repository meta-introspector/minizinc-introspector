## Review of `run_embedding_model_v6.sh`

*   **Purpose:** This script is the primary mechanism for running the MiniZinc `v6` embedding model with full versioned modules and data. It automatically generates a "proof tape" for each run, ensuring precise, traceable, and reproducible experimentation. This is the production version of the script, similar to `run_embedding_model_v6_test.sh` but without the explicit `_test` suffix.
*   **Key Commands and Dependencies:**
    *   `source "$(dirname "$0")/../.env"`: Sources environment variables.
    *   Input parameters: Takes 6 version parameters for the main model and various data files.
    *   `TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")` and `mkdir -p "$PROOF_TAPE_DIR"`: Generates a unique timestamp and creates a directory for the proof tape.
    *   `echo ... > "version_vector.txt"`: Records the exact version vector used for the run within the proof tape.
    *   Dynamic file path construction: Constructs paths to the specific versioned `.mzn` and `.dzn` files.
    *   File existence checks (`if [ ! -f ... ]`): Ensures all required model and data files exist.
    *   `cp ... "$PROOF_TAPE_DIR/"`: Copies all used `.mzn` and `.dzn` files into the proof tape directory for complete reproducibility.
    *   `MINIZINC_COMMAND="..."` and `eval $MINIZINC_COMMAND | tee "${PROOF_TAPE_DIR}/full_output.log" 2>&1`: Constructs and executes the `minizinc` command with various flags (`-s`, `--time-limit`, `--json-stream`) and redirects all output to `full_output.log` within the proof tape, while also printing to stdout using `tee`.
    *   Error checking (`if [ $MINIZINC_EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]`): Checks the MiniZinc exit code for success or failure.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Indirectly relevant. This script runs MiniZinc models that the FFI would interact with. Ensuring these models run correctly and are reproducible is vital for the FFI's overall context.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Directly relevant. This is a core script for executing complex, versioned MiniZinc models. It demonstrates advanced MiniZinc usage, including modularity and data input.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Reproducibility and Traceability:** The automatic generation of "proof tapes" is *fundamental* to the "big idea." If numerical representations are to be reliable and verifiable, their generation process must be fully reproducible. Proof tapes provide the historical record needed for analyzing the evolution of ideas and their corresponding embeddings.
        *   **Version Control of Models/Data:** The use of version vectors for models and data aligns perfectly with the "Monotonic Epic Idea" and the project's philosophy of additive growth. This allows for precise control over the inputs to the semantic embedding process.
        *   **Semantic Embedding (Phase 2):** This script is the direct execution mechanism for Phase 2 of the "big idea," where MiniZinc models process data to generate numerical embeddings.
        *   **OODA Loop:** This script is a key part of the "Act" phase, executing the models, and the "Observe" phase, generating data for analysis.

This script is a cornerstone of the project's experimental methodology, directly supporting the "big idea" through its emphasis on reproducibility and versioned model execution. It is essentially the production version of the `_test` script reviewed previously.
