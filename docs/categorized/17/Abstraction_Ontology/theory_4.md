## Theory 4: SeaLevel Solana, eBPF, LLVM, and Provable Execution

Building upon the preceding theories, the next critical phase involves deriving SeaLevel Solana eBPF LLVM programs. These programs will serve as the executable and provable representations of our system.

This will enable the entire framework to be fully executable and verifiable on our private Solana sidechain. Furthermore, a system will be established to compensate individuals (including ourselves) for their contributions and the computational work performed within this provable and executable environment.
