## Review of `feature_tests/test_empty_model.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This test verifies the FFI's ability to correctly parse an empty MiniZinc model (containing only a comment) and confirms that it has zero items. This is an important edge case test for the parser.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `use crate::tests::GLOBAL_MINIZINC_ENV`: Accesses the global MiniZinc environment.
    *   `env.parse_model(model_code, filename)`: Parses the MiniZinc model from a string.
    *   `model.filename()`, `model.filepath()`, `model.num_items()`: Calls to retrieve model metadata and item count via FFI.
    *   `assert_eq!(model.num_items(), 0)`: Asserts that an empty model correctly reports zero items.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Tests the FFI's parsing capabilities for an edge case, ensuring robustness.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Validates the MiniZinc parser's behavior with minimal input.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Semantic Feature Extraction (Phase 1):** Correctly handling empty or minimal models is important for the semantic feature extraction process. It ensures that the system doesn't crash or misinterpret trivial inputs.
        *   **Robustness:** Edge case testing contributes to the overall robustness of the semantic embedding pipeline.

*   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** This test would fall under `zos-bootstrap test rust-ffi` or `zos-bootstrap test minizinc-features`.
    *   **Internal Module:** The functionalities tested are part of the `minizinc_ffi` crate's `environment` and `model` modules. The test itself would be called by the `commands/test.rs` module.

This test is a good example of edge case testing for the FFI's parsing capabilities.
