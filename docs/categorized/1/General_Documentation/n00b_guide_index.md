# N00b's Guide to libminizinc: Your Journey Begins Here

Welcome, future contributor! This guide is designed to help you get started with the `libminizinc` project, understand its unique vision, and begin making meaningful contributions. We'll walk you through setting up your environment, understanding core concepts, and diving into practical tasks.

## Your Learning Path

We recommend following these tutorials in order to build your understanding progressively:

### 1. Getting Started with libminizinc

*   [**Getting Started: A N00b's Guide to libminizinc**](n00b_guide.md)
    *   This is your very first step. It covers the absolute basics of what `libminizinc` is and how to run the core embedding models.

### 2. Understanding the FFI and Test State

*   [**Reproducing the Current `libminizinc` FFI Test State**](n00b_guide_current_state.md)
    *   Learn about the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) between Rust and C++, and how to reproduce the current test environment. This is crucial for understanding the "oxidation" process.

### 3. Diving into Code Coverage

*   [**Generating and Analyzing C++ Code Coverage Reports**](n00b_guide_coverage_generation.md)
    *   Understand how we measure "oxidation" by generating and analyzing C++ code coverage reports from Rust FFI tests.

### 4. Debugging and Advanced Topics

*   [**Debugging C++ FFI with Code Coverage**](n00b_guide_debugging_coverage.md)
    *   Learn advanced techniques for debugging issues in the C++ FFI using code coverage reports.

## Beyond the Basics

Once you've completed these guides, you'll be well-equipped to explore more advanced topics and contribute to the project. Consider diving into:

*   **Project Vision and Philosophy**: Explore the [LLM FAQ: Open Questions on the Project Vision](../llm_faq.md) and the [Poems Index](../poems/index.md) to deepen your understanding of the project's unique approach.
*   **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Familiarize yourself with our [SOPs Index](../sops/index.md) (once created) for detailed development guidelines.
*   **Contributing**: Refer to the [Contributing section](../../README.md#contributing) in the main README for how to make your first contribution.
