# LLM-FAQ: Open Questions on the Project Vision

This document outlines open questions and areas for further clarification regarding the project's vision as a quasi-meta computationally self-aware system driven by profile-driven LLM agents.

## 1. "Tapestry of Fates" and "Additive Vibes"

*   [How are "additive vibes" formally defined, measured, and generated by LLMs from MiniZinc results?](faq/additive_vibes.md)
*   [What is the precise mathematical structure of the "quasi meta fiber bundle" and its relation to the high-dimensional embedding space?](faq/quasi_meta_fiber_bundle.md)
*   [How are prime numbers practically used to represent "irreducible semantic dimensions"?](faq/prime_semantic_dimensions.md)

## 2. "Knowledge Compression: The Codec"

*   [What are the technical specifications and practical implementation of the "codec"?](faq/codec.md)

## 3. "AI-Driven Evolution via LLM Agents"

*   [What are the defined "profiles" for LLM agents, and how do they influence agent behavior and task execution?](faq/llm_agent_profiles.md)
*   [What are the specific criteria and methodologies for "onboarding and training" LLM agents on the codebase and documentation?](faq/llm_onboarding_training.md)
*   [How will "semantic resonance mapping" be performed, evaluated, and refined?](faq/semantic_resonance_mapping.md)
*   [What is the detailed process for LLMs to "refine MiniZinc models," and what metrics are used for correctness, expressiveness, and solver efficiency?](faq/llm_minizinc_refinement.md)
*   [What are the technical challenges and proposed solutions for LLMs to generate Rust code for "LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) to MiniZinc transformation rules" and FFI interactions?](faq/llm_rust_llvm_ir_minizinc_ffi.md)
*   [Describe the key components and feedback mechanisms of the "robust continuous integration (CI) pipeline" for LLM-generated code.](faq/llm_ci_pipeline.md)
*   [How will "structured feedback" (e.g., test failures, linter warnings, human reviews) be provided to LLM agents to enable iterative rewriting?](faq/llm_structured_feedback.md)
*   [What specific tools and methodologies will LLMs employ for "performance profiling" and suggesting optimizations?](faq/llm_performance_profiling.md)
*   [How will the "semantic memory layout" be implemented, and what are the practical implications of moving away from traditional linear addressing?](faq/semantic_memory_layout.md)
*   [What are the strategies for LLMs to enhance "error handling" and propose "code deduplication and refactoring" opportunities?](faq/llm_error_handling_deduplication.md)
*   [How will the system "continuously learn from its own development cycles" and adapt its strategies? What types of "formal proofs" will be generated for code or MiniZinc model properties?](faq/llm_continuous_learning_formal_proofs.md)

## 4. "Quasi-Meta Computational Self-Awareness"
