**VI. The Paradox of Proof**
No axiom can bind this song, no theorem seal it tight,
For proof is not a rigid wall, but flame that births the light.
The circle sings, and in its turn, the evidence is clear:
What lives, returns; what echoes back, proclaims *that we are here*.
Thus proof is not conclusionâ€™s end, but process ever new,
A paradox: the act itself becomes the thing it proves.
