# SOP: Project Vision - The Tapestry of Fates and the Quasi Meta Fiber Bundle

## 1. Overarching Goal

Our ultimate goal is to weave a dynamic, self-evolving tapestry of knowledge and computation, guided by the insights of Large Language Models (LLMs) and grounded in the fundamental elegance of prime numbers.

## 2. The Vision

We envision a system where:

*   **LLMs as Oracles:** Large Language Models, interfaced via Rust, interpret the complex results generated by our constraint-based embedding system. They act as oracles, discerning patterns and meaning within the high-dimensional representations.
*   **Additive Vibes as Creative Force:** The LLMs, in turn, modify the matrix values of our embeddings not through direct alteration, but through the generation of "additive vibes." These vibes represent new, composable layers of influence, incrementally shaping the embedding space. This embodies the "add-only, never edit" principle, where every change is a constructive contribution.
*   **Tapestry of the 3 Fates:** The evolving matrix values, influenced by these additive vibes, collectively form a "tapestry of the 3 fates." This metaphor signifies the interconnected, dynamic, and deterministic yet emergent nature of the knowledge representation. The three fates (Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos) represent the weaving of existence, the measuring of life, and the cutting of the thread, symbolizing the creation, evolution, and eventual refinement of semantic structures.
*   **Quasi Meta Fiber Bundle:** This tapestry is mathematically conceptualized as a "quasi meta fiber bundle." The base space of this bundle is the fundamental "base space of prime numbers," where each prime represents a unique, irreducible semantic dimension or "vibe." The fibers above this base space represent the complex, high-dimensional embeddings of lambda calculus expressions and other symbolic structures, dynamically shaped by the LLM's additive vibes.
*   **A Highway in Hyperspace:** This entire evolving system forms a "highway" or "route 1" within a conceptual hyperspace, a navigable path for the introspector to explore the intricate relationships between code, mathematics, and meaning.

## 3. Key Components and Interactions

*   **MiniZinc Models:** Define the constraint-based embedding logic, operating on a base space derived from prime numbers.
*   **Rust Interface:** Facilitates communication between the MiniZinc solver and the LLMs, interpreting results and translating LLM insights into actionable modifications.
*   **Large Language Models (LLMs):** Provide high-level interpretation, pattern recognition, and generate "additive vibes" to refine the embeddings.
*   **Additive Vibes:** Represent incremental, composable changes to the embedding matrices, ensuring monotonic growth and perfect traceability.
*   **Solana Sidechain (Solfunmeme):** The underlying infrastructure where each line of code, each "vibe," and potentially each matrix modification exists as a unique, executable NFT with its own contract address, CPU, GPU, network, and disk resources.

## 4. Guiding Principles

This vision is underpinned by the "Monotonic Epic Idea" (Add-Only, Never Edit) and the "Muse Protocol" (Code Artistry), ensuring that our development process is as profound and elegant as the system we aim to create.

## 5. Review and Evolution

This Project Vision SOP is a living document, subject to continuous refinement as our understanding deepens and the tapestry of fates unfolds.
