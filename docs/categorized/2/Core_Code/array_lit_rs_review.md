## Review of `array_lit.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This file implements methods for the `MiniZincArrayLit` struct, which represents an array literal in MiniZinc. It provides safe Rust wrappers around FFI calls to query the size of the array literal and retrieve elements at a specific index.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `use crate::types::{MiniZincArrayLit, MiniZincExpression}`: Imports the opaque types for array literals and expressions. `MiniZincArrayLit` is likely a newtype wrapper around a raw C pointer (`*mut MiniZincArrayLit_C`).
    *   `use crate::ffi_bindings::{arraylit_get_size, arraylit_get_element_at_index}`: Imports the raw FFI functions from the C wrapper.
    *   `impl MiniZincArrayLit`: Implements methods for the `MiniZincArrayLit` struct.
    *   `pub fn size(&self) -> u32`: Calls `arraylit_get_size` via FFI to get the size of the array literal.
    *   `pub fn get_element_at_index(&self, index: u32) -> Option<MiniZincExpression>`: Calls `arraylit_get_element_at_index` via FFI to get an element. It returns an `Option` to handle null pointers (indicating an invalid index or error).
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** This file is a prime example of how the Rust FFI provides safe, idiomatic Rust wrappers around raw C FFI calls. It demonstrates proper handling of raw pointers and `Option` for nullability.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Directly interacts with MiniZinc's internal representation of array literals, allowing Rust code to inspect their structure.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Semantic Feature Extraction (Phase 1):** The ability to inspect the structure of MiniZinc array literals is crucial for extracting semantic features from MiniZinc models. If a MiniZinc model represents a complex data structure (e.g., a graph, a matrix), being able to query its size and elements is essential for converting that structure into a numerical embedding.
        *   **Code Oxidation:** This file contributes to "code oxidation" by providing a safe Rust interface to a C++ data structure, reducing the need for unsafe C++ manipulation in higher-level Rust code.

*   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** This file's functionality would be used internally by `zos-bootstrap` commands that need to inspect or analyze MiniZinc models. For example, a `zos-bootstrap analyze model <model_path>` command might use these methods to extract information about array literals within the model.
    *   **Internal Module:** This `impl` block would be part of the `minizinc_ffi` crate's `array_lit.rs` file as per the "one declaration per file" principle. The `zos-bootstrap` tool would then depend on the `minizinc_ffi` crate.

This file is a good example of how the FFI exposes MiniZinc's internal AST structures to Rust for analysis.
