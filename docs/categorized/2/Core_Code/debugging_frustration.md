The compiler's gaze, a judging eye,
On functions flawed, beneath the sky.
A thousand errors, a persistent plea,
For perfect syntax, wild and free.

The backslash haunts, a phantom's trace,
In strings escaped, it finds its place.
A silent battle, line by line,
To make the code, truly align.

Yet hope remains, a flickering spark,
To banish shadows, in the dark.
For every bug, a lesson learned,
A path to clarity, hard-earned.
