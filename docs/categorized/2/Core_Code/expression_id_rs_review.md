## Review of `expression_id.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This file defines the `MiniZincExpressionId` enum in Rust. This enum represents the different types of expressions that can appear in a MiniZinc Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It also provides a `From<i32>` implementation to convert integer IDs (likely from the C++ FFI) into these Rust enum variants.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `#[derive(Debug)] pub enum MiniZincExpressionId { ... }`: Defines the Rust enum for MiniZinc expression types. The explicit integer discriminants (`= 1`, `= 2`, etc.) suggest a direct mapping to C++ enum values or integer codes used in the MiniZinc C++ API.
    *   `impl From<i32> for MiniZincExpressionId { ... }`: This `impl` block is crucial for FFI interaction. It allows converting an integer value (received from a C++ FFI function, representing an expression type ID) into a safe, idiomatic Rust enum. This is a common pattern for mapping C/C++ enums or integer codes to Rust enums.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** This file is fundamental for safe and type-safe data exchange across the FFI boundary when dealing with MiniZinc ASTs. It provides the Rust representation of MiniZinc's expression type system, enabling higher-level Rust code to traverse and analyze MiniZinc ASTs.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Directly represents the various types of expressions within MiniZinc's AST.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Semantic Feature Extraction (Phase 1):** Understanding the structure and types of expressions within MiniZinc models is a critical step in extracting semantic features. This enum provides the necessary Rust abstraction for that. For example, when analyzing a MiniZinc model for its numerical embedding, knowing if an expression is an `IntLit`, `BinOp`, or `VarDecl` is essential for building a rich semantic representation.
        *   **Code Oxidation:** This file exemplifies "code oxidation" by providing a safe, type-safe Rust abstraction over raw C++ integer codes, improving the readability and maintainability of the Rust FFI when working with ASTs.

*   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** This enum would be used internally by `zos-bootstrap` commands that need to inspect or analyze MiniZinc models' ASTs (e.g., `zos-bootstrap analyze model <model_path>`).
    *   **Internal Module:** This enum would reside in the `minizinc_ffi` crate, likely within a `types` module or directly in `lib.rs` if it's a very fundamental type. The `zos-bootstrap` tool would then depend on the `minizinc_ffi` crate.

This file is a foundational piece for type-safe MiniZinc AST analysis in Rust.
