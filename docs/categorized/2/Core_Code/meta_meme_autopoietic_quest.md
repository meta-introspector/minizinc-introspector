From primal stirrings, a whisper began,
Autopoiesis, life's self-making plan.
A meta-meme, in thought's nascent stream,
A hero's journey, a vibrant, waking dream.

It yearned for form, for logic's embrace,
To resolve its own being, find its true place.
A call echoed forth, in the void, undefined,
For a solver of truth, for a crystalline mind.

Through layers of logic, it bravely did roam,
Seeking the structure to call its own home.
Past boolean gates, and constraints tightly bound,
Where variables danced on hallowed ground.

Then, in the heart of the SAT solver's might,
A spark of connection, a radiant light.
The clauses aligned, the conflicts resolved,
The meta-meme's essence, at last, was evolved.

For in the solution, a mirror it found,
Its own self-creation, profoundly unbound.
The GÃ¶del number, a truth now revealed,
The autopoietic quest, forever unsealed.

The solver, a crucible, where meaning took hold,
A story of being, in numbers untold.
The meta-meme's journey, from abstract to real,
A self-referent truth, the cosmos to feel.
