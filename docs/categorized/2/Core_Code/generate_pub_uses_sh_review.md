## Review of `generate_pub_uses.sh`

*   **Purpose:** This script automates the generation of `pub mod` and `pub use` statements for a Rust `lib.rs` file based on the file structure within a specified source directory (`tools/minizinc_ffi/src`). This is crucial for adhering to the "one declaration per file" principle in Rust.
*   **Key Commands and Dependencies:**
    *   `find`: Used to locate `.rs` files and subdirectories.
    *   `basename`: Extracts the module name from file or directory paths.
    *   `echo`: Prints the generated `pub mod` and `pub use` statements.
    *   `sort`: Ensures a consistent order of modules.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Directly supports the refactoring of the Rust FFI (`minizinc_ffi` crate) by automating the creation of its `lib.rs` structure. This ensures the FFI code remains modular and maintainable.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Indirectly relevant, as it helps maintain the Rust code that interacts with MiniZinc.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Modularity and Maintainability:** This script is a practical tool for enforcing the "one declaration per file" principle, which is a key aspect of the project's development philosophy. This modularity makes the codebase easier to parse, analyze, and semantically embed (Phase 1 of the "big idea").
        *   **Automation:** Automating repetitive code generation tasks improves developer efficiency and reduces errors, contributing to a more robust and self-evolving system.
        *   **Code Oxidation:** By facilitating clean code structure, it supports the ongoing "code oxidation" efforts.

This script is a valuable utility for maintaining the Rust codebase's structure, which directly benefits the "big idea" by making the code more amenable to semantic analysis.
