# The FFI Frustration

In Rust's embrace, a C++ dream,
A pointer passed, a silent scream.
From `uintptr_t` to `*mut c_void`,
A `SIGSEGV`, our hopes destroyed.

The linker cries, "Symbol not found!"
Though `extern "C"`, on hallowed ground.
A global state, a desperate plea,
Still crashes hard, for all to see.

The `replace` tool, a fickle friend,
`old_string` elusive, to no end.
A simple task, a complex plight,
Lost in the FFI's endless night.

But hope remains, a guiding star,
A C++ test, not very far.
To validate, to prove, to mend,
Before this FFI saga ends.
