The silicon hums, a digital sigh,
Where logic gates, like starlings, fly.
A thousand thoughts, a million lines,
In binary dreams, the code entwines.

A loop of longing, a recursive plea,
For perfect syntax, wild and free.
The compiler's gaze, a judging eye,
On functions flawed, beneath the sky.

Oh, `main` function, heart of the beast,
From endless errors, grant release.
A `println!` echo, in the void,
A silent promise, unalloyed.

The `git` commits, a history deep,
Where phantom bugs forever sleep.
A `Cargo.toml`, a whispered prayer,
For dependencies, beyond compare.

The `syn` tree sways, a parse-time breeze,
Through abstract branches, rustling ease.
A `HashMap` of forgotten lore,
Keys unkeyed, forevermore.

The `sed` script, a whispered command,
To reshape worlds, with unseen hand.
A `glob` of stars, a cosmic gleam,
Reflecting back, a coding dream.

The `constants` stand, in rigid grace,
Immutable truths, in time and space.
But `var`s they dance, a fluid art,
Reflecting changes, in the heart.

A `panic!` cry, a sudden halt,
A cosmic error, not my fault.
The `Result` enum, hope and dread,
A path uncertain, bravely led.

So let the warnings softly chime,
A gentle rhythm, marking time.
For in this dance of logic's might,
We seek the truth, in digital light.

### `fn main()`: The Genesis Block

A function's journey, from void to form,
Through `clap`'s embrace, weathering the storm.
Arguments parsed, a destiny cast,
In `Result`'s promise, holding fast.

```rust
/// The entry point, a cosmic gate,
/// Where user's will, meets digital fate.
/// From CLI's whisper, a command takes flight,
/// Guiding the system, through day and night.
fn main() -> Result<()> { /* ... */ }
```

### `mod constants`: The Immutable Scrolls

Here lie the truths, in `pub const` enshrined,
A lexicon fixed, for all mankind.
No shifting sands, no transient whim,
Just steadfast values, from limb to limb.

```rust
/// A sacred tablet, etched in code,
/// Bearing the burdens, of logic's load.
/// From `MSG_BUILDING_GECODE`, a message clear,
/// Dispelling doubt, and banishing fear.
pub mod constants;
```

### `mod build_constants`: The Refactored Tablets

From ancient scrolls, new tablets rise,
Refined and focused, beneath Rust's skies.
A cleaner vision, a modular dream,
Where constants flow, a crystalline stream.

```rust
/// A curated collection, sharp and bright,
/// Guiding the builder, with focused light.
/// From `MKDIR`'s call, to `CMAKE`'s might,
/// Orchestrating progress, in pure delight.
pub mod build_constants;
```

### `fn escape_for_sed()`: The Alchemist's Art

A delicate dance, of backslash and slash,
Transforming chaos, in a single dash.
For `sed`'s strict parsing, a ritual old,
Where literal truths, are bravely told.

```rust
/// A transmutation, subtle and deep,
/// Where special characters, their secrets keep.
/// From raw string's essence, a new form's born,
/// For shell's consumption, by dawn's first morn.
fn escape_for_sed(s: &str) -> String { /* ... */ }
```

### `struct ExtractedString`: The Semantic Atom

A captured whisper, from code's vast sea,
A string's identity, for all to see.
With crate and module, function and name,
A tiny truth, igniting the flame.

```rust
/// A data capsule, precise and small,
/// Holding the essence, of each string's call.
/// From `Value: "..."`, a story unfolds,
/// In structured beauty, as time beholds.
pub struct ExtractedString { /* ... */ }
```

### `trait Visit`: The Seeker's Path

Through AST's forest, a silent tread,
Where nodes and branches, softly spread.
A quest for knowledge, hidden and deep,
The `syn` visitor, secrets to keep.

```rust
/// A guided journey, through syntax's maze,
/// Unveiling patterns, in code's intricate haze.
/// From `visit_path`, a revelation springs,
/// The hidden connections, that the compiler sings.
impl<'ast> Visit<'ast> for ConstantUsageVisitor { /* ... */ }
```

### `fn prove_constants_usage_command()`: The Oracle's Verdict

A solemn judgment, a truth revealed,
On constants' purpose, now unsealed.
Are all strings needed, in this grand design?
The oracle speaks, a truth divine.

```rust
/// A rigorous audit, of each constant's fate,
/// Determining purpose, before it's too late.
/// From `defined_constants`, to `used_constants`' embrace,
/// A testament to order, in this digital space.
pub fn prove_constants_usage_command(project_root: &PathBuf) -> Result<()> { /* ... */ }
```
