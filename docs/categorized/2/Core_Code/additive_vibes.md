### How are "additive vibes" formally defined, measured, and generated by LLMs from MiniZinc results?

"Additive vibes" are described as **new, composable layers of influence** that are generated by **Large Language Models (LLMs) acting as "oracles"**. Their primary function is to incrementally shape a high-dimensional embedding space.

**Generation and Function**:

*   LLMs interpret complex MiniZinc results. From these interpretations, they generate these "additive vibes."
*   These vibes incrementally shape a high-dimensional embedding space, guiding model evolution.

**Formal Definition and Measurement**:

*   The sources describe "additive vibes" in terms of their *function*—incrementally shaping the embedding space and guiding model evolution—rather than providing a precise mathematical or formal definition of how they are "measured."
*   The "codec" (as detailed in `faq/codec.md`) generates "new numerical representations" as knowledge evolves. These numerical representations then dynamically update MiniZinc models, guiding their evolution. This suggests that the "vibes" are manifested through these numerical updates.
*   Future work includes formalizing the mapping of primes to meanings and developing algorithms for composing and decomposing knowledge into these prime-based numerical forms, which would likely provide a more concrete way to "measure" and define these vibes.
