## Review of `test_01_init_global_env.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This test verifies that the global MiniZinc environment (`GLOBAL_MINIZINC_ENV`) can be successfully initialized and accessed. It's a foundational test, ensuring the very first step of MiniZinc interaction is stable.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `use crate::tests::tests::GLOBAL_MINIZINC_ENV`: Accesses the global MiniZinc environment.
    *   `let _env = GLOBAL_MINIZINC_ENV.lock().unwrap()`: This line triggers the lazy initialization of `GLOBAL_MINIZINC_ENV` (if it hasn't already been initialized by another test) and acquires a lock on the mutex, ensuring exclusive access to the `MiniZincEnvironment`. This implicitly involves the FFI call `minizinc_env_new()` and `minizinc_gc_lock()` as defined in `tests/mod.rs`.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Directly tests the FFI's ability to create and manage the MiniZinc environment, including the critical GC locking mechanism. This is the absolute first step in any FFI interaction with MiniZinc.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Verifies the successful initialization of the MiniZinc environment.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Foundational Stability:** This test ensures the foundational stability required for all subsequent steps of the "big idea." Without a stable MiniZinc environment, no semantic embedding can occur.
        *   **Reliability:** The success of this test is a strong indicator of the FFI's reliability in its most basic function.
        *   **Code Oxidation:** This test validates the Rust code responsible for managing the MiniZinc environment, which is a key aspect of "code oxidation."

*   **Integration into Rust Busy Box (`ragit-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** This test would fall under `ragit-bootstrap test rust-ffi`.
    *   **Internal Module:** The global environment initialization logic is primarily within `minizinc_ffi/src/tests/mod.rs`. The test itself would be called by the `commands/test.rs` module. The `minizinc_env_new()` FFI call is part of the `environment` module.

This test is a crucial, low-level validation of the FFI's ability to establish a working MiniZinc context.
