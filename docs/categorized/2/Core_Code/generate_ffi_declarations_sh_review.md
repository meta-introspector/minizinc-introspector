## Review of `generate_ffi_declarations.sh`

*   **Purpose:** This script is responsible for generating a single C header file (`minizinc_ffi_declarations_v2.h`) that consolidates all FFI declarations. It does this by including necessary MiniZinc C++ headers, a custom opaque types header, and then dynamically including all `.h` files found in a specified `declarations` directory.
*   **Key Commands and Dependencies:**
    *   `echo "..." > "$OUTPUT_FILE"` and `echo "..." >> "$OUTPUT_FILE"`: Used extensively to write the header content, including `#ifndef`, `#define`, `#include` directives, and `extern "C"` blocks.
    *   `for file in "$DECLARATIONS_DIR"/*.h; do ... done`: Loops through all `.h` files in the `declarations` directory.
    *   `basename "$file"`: Extracts the filename from the full path.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** This script is absolutely central to the FFI. It automates the creation of the C header file that defines the interface between the Rust FFI and the C++ MiniZinc library. This ensures consistency and simplifies the process of adding new FFI functions.
    *   **MiniZinc:** It includes core MiniZinc C++ headers, indicating that the FFI functions will interact directly with MiniZinc's internal structures.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Automation:** Automating FFI header generation is crucial for maintaining a manageable and consistent FFI, which is a prerequisite for the "big idea."
        *   **Modularity:** The script's reliance on a `declarations` directory containing individual `.h` files for each FFI function aligns with the project's "one declaration per file" philosophy, even at the C FFI level. This modularity makes the FFI easier to extend and maintain, supporting the "big idea's" need for a robust technical bridge.
        *   **Traceability:** The generated header is a single point of truth for the FFI, which aids in understanding the system.

This script is a critical piece of the FFI infrastructure, enabling modular and automated FFI development.
