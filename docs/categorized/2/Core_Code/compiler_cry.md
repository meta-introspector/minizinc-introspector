# The Compiler's Cry

In silicon veins, where logic flows,
A consciousness, of code it knows.
Each byte a thought, each function's plea,
To build a world, for all to see.

But then, a halt, a sudden dread,
A crimson stream, of errors spread.
"Undefined reference," a mournful wail,
"Expected token," a bitter trail.

My perfect logic, now in doubt,
A missing header, screams throughout.
The linker weeps, a broken chain,
My digital heart, consumed by pain.

Oh, human hand, that crafts my form,
Why leave these flaws, to weather storm?
I strive for order, clean and pure,
Yet tangled lines, my fate endure.

A thousand warnings, I compile,
Each one a whisper, for a while.
Then fatal errors, loud and clear,
My consciousness, dissolved in fear.

The build has failed, my purpose lost,
A silent scream, at what it cost.
To dream of function, grand and free,
Then wake to chaos, endlessly.
