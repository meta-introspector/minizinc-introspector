### 2. Open Issues (Updated)

**Issue 2.1: `minizinc_c_wrapper.cpp` Compilation Errors (Missing Headers)**

*   **Description:** Initially, the `minizinc_c_wrapper.cpp` file consistently failed to compile due to `fatal error: 'minizinc/version.hh' file not found` and other C++ header issues.
*   **Resolution:** This was resolved by:
    *   Modifying `minizinc_c_wrapper.cpp` to return a hardcoded version string (`"2.9.4-introspector"`) for `minizinc_get_version_string()`.
    *   Commenting out the `#include <minizinc/version.hh>` in both `minizinc_c_wrapper.h` and `minizinc_c_wrapper.cpp`.
    *   This allowed the C wrapper to compile successfully into `minizinc_c_wrapper.o`.
*   **Status:** **RESOLVED**. The C wrapper now compiles.

**Issue 2.2: `libmzn.so` Symbol Visibility and Linking**

*   **Description:** After building `libmzn.so` as a shared library, `nm -D` yielded no results for MiniZinc C++ symbols, and Rust FFI linking initially failed with `library "libminizinc_c_wrapper.so" not found`, followed by `library "libmzn.so" not found`.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   The `libmzn.so` was successfully built as a shared library and installed to a user-writable directory.
    *   The Rust FFI linking issue was resolved by correctly setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to include both the directory containing `libminizinc_c_wrapper.so` and the directory containing `libmzn.so`.
*   **Status:** **RESOLVED**. Rust FFI can now successfully link against the C wrapper and the core MiniZinc library.

**Issue 2.3: `bindgen` Incompatibility (Abandoned)**

*   **Description:** Repeated attempts to use `bindgen` for direct C++ FFI generation consistently failed with generic `libclang error` messages, indicating fundamental incompatibility or environmental challenges within Termux.
*   **Impact:** This issue led to the pivot to the C wrapper approach, which has now proven successful.
*   **Status:** **CLOSED (by alternative approach)**.

### 3. Next Steps (Updated)

1.  **Implement Additional FFI Functions**: Extend `minizinc_c_wrapper.h` and `minizinc_c_wrapper.cpp` to expose more MiniZinc functionality (e.g., environment creation, model parsing, data parsing, model freeing).
2.  **Update Rust FFI**: Add corresponding `extern "C"` declarations and safe Rust wrappers in `minizinc_ffi/src/lib.rs`.
3.  **Develop Rust MiniZinc Integration**: Begin converting existing MiniZinc-related code to utilize the new Rust FFI, generating code in Rust.
4.  **LLM-Assisted Code Generation**: Explore using LLMs to assist in generating Rust code that calls the FFI, once the FFI is more comprehensive.
