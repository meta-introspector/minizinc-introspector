### How will "semantic resonance mapping" be performed, evaluated, and refined?

"Semantic resonance mapping" involves iteratively mapping abstract code concepts to their corresponding semantic embeddings. This process is crucial for enabling LLMs to effectively understand, generate, and evolve the codebase using rich numerical representations.

**Performance**:

*   **LLM-driven Generation**: LLMs are expected to generate initial mappings between code concepts (e.g., function names, variable roles, architectural patterns) and their semantic embeddings. This might involve analyzing code comments, documentation, and the code structure itself.
*   **Numerical Representation**: The semantic embeddings are likely to be the numerical representations generated by the "codec," where prime numbers encode fundamental meanings and complex concepts are compositions of these primes.
*   **Contextual Information**: The mapping process will be informed by contextual data provided in prompts, such as input data nomenclature, usage examples, and knowledge graph information.

**Evaluation**:

*   **Consistency Checks**: Evaluation could involve checking the consistency of the generated mappings. For example, if two different code constructs are semantically similar, their embeddings should be close in the high-dimensional space.
*   **Human Review**: Human developers will likely play a role in reviewing and validating the initial semantic mappings, providing feedback to the LLMs.
*   **Downstream Task Performance**: The ultimate evaluation of semantic resonance mapping will be its impact on downstream tasks, such as the accuracy and quality of LLM-generated code, the efficiency of MiniZinc models, and the effectiveness of theorem proving.

**Refinement**:

*   **Iterative Feedback Loops**: The project emphasizes iterative refinement and learning from development cycles. Feedback from validation steps (e.g., test failures, linter warnings) can be used to refine the semantic mappings.
*   **Adaptive Prompts**: Feedback regarding the performance of generated constraints or solutions can be appended to the prompt for subsequent iterations, allowing the LLM to continuously learn and adapt its strategies, including how it performs semantic resonance mapping.
*   **Fine-tuning Embedding Models**: Beyond prompt engineering for the LLMs themselves, fine-tuning of embedding models (e.g., for Retrieval Augmented Generation - RAG) can improve retrieval accuracy and the representation of relevance between queries and documents, which directly impacts semantic resonance mapping.
