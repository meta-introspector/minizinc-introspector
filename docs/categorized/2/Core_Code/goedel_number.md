# Gödel Number

A Gödel number is a unique number assigned to each symbol and well-formed formula within a formal system. This allows statements about the system to be represented as numbers, enabling self-reference and the exploration of meta-mathematical properties.

In this project, Gödel numbers are used to arithmetize code and concepts, bridging formal logic with computational structures. They serve as a numerical representation of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and other project knowledge, which can then be manipulated and solved for by MiniZinc models, facilitating **token/AST regeneration** and other forms of constrained generation.
