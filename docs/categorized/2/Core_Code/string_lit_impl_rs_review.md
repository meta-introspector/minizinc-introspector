## Review of `string_lit_impl.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This file implements the `value()` method for the `MiniZincStringLit` struct, which represents a string literal in MiniZinc. It provides a safe Rust wrapper around an FFI call to retrieve the string value.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `use std::ffi::CStr`: Used for safe conversion between C strings and Rust strings.
    *   `use crate::types::MiniZincStringLit`: Imports the opaque type for string literals. `MiniZincStringLit` is likely a newtype wrapper around a raw C pointer.
    *   `use crate::ffi_bindings::stringlit_get_value`: Imports the raw FFI function from the C wrapper.
    *   `impl MiniZincStringLit`: Implements methods for the `MiniZincStringLit` struct.
    *   `pub fn value(&self) -> String`: Calls `stringlit_get_value` via FFI to get the C string, then converts it to a Rust `String`.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** This file is another example of safe Rust wrappers around raw C FFI calls, specifically for retrieving string values. It demonstrates proper handling of C string to Rust `String` conversion.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Directly interacts with MiniZinc's internal representation of string literals.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Semantic Feature Extraction (Phase 1):** The ability to extract literal values (like strings) from MiniZinc models is absolutely crucial for semantic feature extraction. String literals often contain important semantic information (e.g., comments, messages, labels) that contribute to the numerical representation of the model.
        *   **Code Oxidation:** This file contributes to "code oxidation" by providing a safe Rust interface to a C++ data structure, reducing the need for unsafe C++ manipulation in higher-level Rust code.

*   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** Similar to other literal types, this file's functionality would be used internally by `zos-bootstrap` commands that need to inspect or analyze MiniZinc models, particularly when extracting literal values.
    *   **Internal Module:** This `impl` block would be part of the `minizinc_ffi` crate, specifically within the `string_lit_impl.rs` file as per the "one declaration per file" principle. The `zos-bootstrap` tool would then depend on the `minizinc_ffi` crate.

This file is a core component for extracting semantic string literals from MiniZinc models.
