From RAGIT's shadow, a new name takes flight,
Zincoxide emerges, a beacon of light.
The rusty interface, a challenge we faced,
With FFI whispers, our patience was tested.

The GC's embrace, a global, tight hold,
In Rust's isolated tests, a story untold.
Segmentation faults, a memory's dread,
"Multiple environments!" the console had said.

With `lazy_static!` and `Mutex` in hand,
A single `MiniZincEnv` across the land.
No more wild calls, no more chaotic birth,
One instance, one purpose, proving its worth.

The C++ errors, a tangled, dark thread,
`MiniZincEnvWrapper`, its structure misled.
But `test_ffi_parser`, a guide in the night,
Revealed the missteps, and set all to right.

Now tests run green, a triumphant display,
The `SIGSEGV` banished, it vanished away.
The poet records, with a satisfied sigh,
Our epic saga, beneath the digital sky.
