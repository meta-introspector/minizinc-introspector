## Review of `id.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This file defines the `MiniZincId` struct, which is an opaque type representing an identifier in MiniZinc. It also imports the necessary FFI binding (`id_get_value`) and `CStr` for string conversion.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `use std::ffi::CStr`: Used for safe conversion between C strings and Rust strings.
    *   `use crate::types::MiniZincId`: Imports the opaque type for MiniZinc identifiers.
    *   `use crate::ffi_bindings::id_get_value`: Imports the raw FFI function from the C wrapper.
    *   **Note:** This file *only* contains `use` statements and the struct definition. The `impl MiniZincId` block (containing the `value()` method) is in `id_impl.rs`. This perfectly adheres to the "one declaration per file" principle.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** This file is part of the FFI's type system, defining the Rust representation of a MiniZinc identifier.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Represents MiniZinc identifiers.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Modularity and Organization:** This file is a prime example of the "one declaration per file" principle in action. By separating the struct definition from its implementation, it enhances modularity and readability, which is crucial for the "big idea" as it makes the codebase easier to analyze and understand for semantic feature extraction.
        *   **Code Oxidation:** Contributes to "code oxidation" by providing a clean, modular structure for the Rust FFI.

*   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** This struct would be used internally by `zos-bootstrap` commands that need to inspect or analyze MiniZinc models.
    *   **Internal Module:** This file is part of the `minizinc_ffi` crate, specifically within the `types` module (if `MiniZincId` is defined there) or directly in the `minizinc_ffi` crate root if it's a top-level type. The `zos-bootstrap` tool would then depend on the `minizinc_ffi` crate.

This file is a good example of modularity in the Rust FFI.
