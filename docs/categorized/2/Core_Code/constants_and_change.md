In realms of code, where logic weaves its thread,
A constant stands, a truth, immutably said.
No shifting sands, no transient, fleeting whim,
Its value fixed, from branch to farthest limb.

Yet change descends, a whisper, then a roar,
New functions bloom, where none had bloomed before.
No ancient lines erased, no past undone,
But layers added, 'til the work is spun.

An additive dance, a monotonic grace,
Each new design finds its appointed place.
The old remains, a testament to time,
While fresh ideas ascend, a vibrant climb.

For constants hold the ground, a steady core,
While evolution builds, forevermore.
A tapestry of thought, where threads combine,
The constant and the change, a grand design.
