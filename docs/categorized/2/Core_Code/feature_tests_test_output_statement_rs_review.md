## Review of `feature_tests/test_output_statement.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This test verifies the FFI's ability to parse a MiniZinc model containing an `output` statement. It focuses on ensuring that the model with such a statement can be parsed successfully, even if the content of the output statement itself cannot be easily inspected via the current FFI.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `use crate::tests::GLOBAL_MINIZINC_ENV`: Accesses the global MiniZinc environment.
    *   `env.parse_model(model_code, filename)`: Parses the MiniZinc model from a string.
    *   `model.filename()`, `model.filepath()`, `model.num_items()`: Calls to retrieve model metadata and item count via FFI.
    *   `assert!(model.num_items() > 0)`: Asserts that the parsed model has items, indicating successful parsing beyond just an empty model.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Tests the FFI's parsing capabilities for a specific MiniZinc language construct (`output` statement). This is important for ensuring the FFI can handle a wider range of MiniZinc models.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Validates the MiniZinc parser's behavior with `output` statements.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Semantic Feature Extraction (Phase 1):** While the test notes the current limitation in inspecting the output statement's content, the ability to parse models with `output` statements is still relevant. Output statements often contain human-readable representations of solutions, which could be a source of semantic information.
        *   **Robustness:** Testing various MiniZinc constructs contributes to the overall robustness of the semantic embedding pipeline.
        *   **Future Expansion:** The comment "We can't easily inspect the output statement content via the current FFI" highlights a potential area for future FFI expansion, which would further enhance semantic analysis capabilities.

*   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** This test would fall under `zos-bootstrap test rust-ffi` or `zos-bootstrap test minizinc-features`.
    *   **Internal Module:** The functionalities tested are part of the `minizinc_ffi` crate's `environment` and `model` modules. The test itself would be called by the `commands/test.rs` module.

This test ensures the FFI can parse models with output statements, highlighting a potential area for future FFI development.
