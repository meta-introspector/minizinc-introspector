## Review of `build_gecode.sh`

*   **Purpose:** This script builds the Gecode constraint programming library, which is likely used as a solver backend for MiniZinc.
*   **Key Commands and Dependencies:**
    *   `source "$(dirname "$0")/../.env"`: Sources the project's `.env` file to load environment variables, including `GECODE_BUILD_DIR`.
    *   `mkdir -p "$GECODE_BUILD_DIR"`: Creates the build directory for Gecode.
    *   `cd "$GECODE_BUILD_DIR"`: Changes to the Gecode build directory.
    *   `cmake .. -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5`: Configures the Gecode build using CMake, explicitly setting the minimum CMake policy version.
    *   `make`: Compiles Gecode.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Indirectly relevant. Gecode is a solver that MiniZinc might use. A working Gecode build ensures MiniZinc has its required dependencies, which in turn supports the FFI's ability to interact with a fully functional MiniZinc.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Directly relevant as it builds a key component (Gecode) that MiniZinc relies on for solving constraint problems.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Infrastructure:** This script is part of the foundational infrastructure required for the "big idea." A functional MiniZinc environment, including its solvers, is essential for Phase 2 (MiniZinc-Driven Semantic Embedding and Numerical Transformation).
        *   **Reliability:** Ensuring that Gecode builds successfully contributes to the overall reliability of the MiniZinc ecosystem.

This script is important for setting up the MiniZinc environment, which is a prerequisite for the "big idea."
