### What is the precise mathematical structure of the "quasi meta fiber bundle" and its relation to the high-dimensional embedding space?

The "tapestry" itself is mathematically conceptualized as a **"quasi meta fiber bundle"**.

**Relation to Embedding Space**:

*   This fiber bundle structure underlies the high-dimensional embedding space where lambda calculus expressions are embedded.
*   The embedding process involves placing subterms of lambda calculus expressions into a unitary Riemannian manifold in 8 dimensions (specifically, a unit 7-sphere), reflecting their semantic and structural properties via a constraint solver.
