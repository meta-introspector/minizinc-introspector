## Review of `build_and_test.sh`

*   **Purpose:** This script is a simple wrapper that first builds the C++ wrapper and then runs Cargo tests, seemingly using a specific crash reproduction script.
*   **Key Commands and Dependencies:**
    *   `cmake --build build/`: Builds the C++ project located in the `build/` directory. This would typically build `libminizinc` and its C wrapper.
    *   `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/reproduce_crash.sh`: This is a direct call to another script, implying that the "tests" being run are specifically designed to reproduce a crash.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Directly involved in building the C++ wrapper (part of the FFI) and then running tests that likely exercise the FFI.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Indirectly involved, as the C++ wrapper and Rust tests interact with MiniZinc.
    *   **"Big Idea":** This script highlights the project's focus on debugging and stability, which are crucial for the reliability of the "big idea." The use of a "reproduce_crash.sh" script suggests a strong emphasis on identifying and fixing critical issues, which aligns with the OODA loop and the pursuit of a robust, self-aware system.

This script is a basic build-and-test automation, but its reliance on a crash reproduction script makes it particularly relevant to the project's debugging efforts.
