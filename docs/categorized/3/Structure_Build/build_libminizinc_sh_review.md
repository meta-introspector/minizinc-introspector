## Review of `build_libminizinc.sh`

*   **Purpose:** This script builds the core `libminizinc` library itself.
*   **Key Commands and Dependencies:**
    *   `source "$(dirname "$0")/../.env"`: Sources the project's `.env` file to load environment variables like `LIBMINIZINC_BUILD_DIR`, `MINIZINC_PROJECT_ROOT`, and `GECODE_BUILD_DIR`.
    *   `mkdir -p "$LIBMINIZINC_BUILD_DIR"`: Creates the build directory for `libminizinc`.
    *   `cd "$LIBMINIZINC_BUILD_DIR"`: Changes to the `libminizinc` build directory.
    *   `cmake "$MINIZINC_PROJECT_ROOT" -DGecode_ROOT="$GECODE_BUILD_DIR"`: Configures the `libminizinc` build using CMake. Crucially, it passes the `Gecode_ROOT` variable, indicating that `libminizinc` is being built with Gecode support.
    *   `make`: Compiles `libminizinc`.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** This script builds the underlying C++ library (`libmzn.so`) that the C wrapper and Rust FFI interact with. A successful build of `libminizinc` is a fundamental prerequisite for the entire FFI stack.
    *   **MiniZinc:** This is the core MiniZinc library build script.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Foundational Infrastructure:** This script is absolutely essential for the "big idea." Without a successfully built `libminizinc`, Phase 2 (MiniZinc-Driven Semantic Embedding and Numerical Transformation) cannot proceed.
        *   **Dependency Management:** The explicit passing of `Gecode_ROOT` highlights the project's attention to managing external dependencies for a complete MiniZinc environment.

This script is a cornerstone of the project's build system, directly enabling the MiniZinc functionality that the "big idea" relies upon.
