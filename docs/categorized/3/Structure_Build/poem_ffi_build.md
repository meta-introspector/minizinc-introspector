In Rust's embrace, a solver's plea,
For MiniZinc, a binding free.
But FFI's path, a tangled thread,
With `.so` files, nowhere led.

`zos-bootstrap`, our guiding light,
Built with purpose, strong and bright.
Yet `cmake`'s whisper, soft and low,
Sent build files where they shouldn't go.

Through `println!`'s gaze, a truth unfurled,
Build artifacts, in a different world.
`-B` argument, a simple key,
Unlocked the path, for all to see.

Refactored functions, clean and clear,
Dispelled the shadows, banished fear.
Each step precise, a task defined,
Leaving complexity far behind.

Though Android's tests still softly sigh,
For linked libraries, passing by,
The wrapper's built, a victory won,
Our debugging odyssey, bravely run.
