Subject: Important Policy Update: Data Retention and Immutability

Team,

Effective immediately, we are implementing a strict policy of **no deletion** for any project-related data, including all builds, artifacts, and intermediate outputs. This applies to both current and historical versions.

This change is critical for ensuring complete traceability, reproducibility, and auditability across all our development cycles. It aligns with our core principles of monotonic, additive, and Godelian system evolution, where every state and every build contributes to the overall knowledge base.

Please ensure all automated scripts, manual processes, and local habits are adjusted to comply with this new directive. If you have any questions or require assistance in adapting your workflows, please reach out to the lead engineers.

Thank you for your cooperation in maintaining the integrity and completeness of our project's history.
