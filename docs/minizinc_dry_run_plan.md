## MiniZinc Dry Run Plan (Revised)

**Problem Encountered:**
During the attempt to run MiniZinc for a single chunk, a persistent `Error: type error: undefined identifier 'num_relations'` was encountered, pointing to `data_declarations.mzn`. This error occurs even when `data_declarations.mzn` is passed explicitly as a data file or included by a simple test model. This suggests a fundamental issue with how this specific MiniZinc environment is parsing data definitions within included `.dzn` files, or a very subtle interaction with the model's structure. This issue prevents a full, successful execution of the MiniZinc model at this time.

**Despite this parsing issue, here is the conceptual "dry run" plan for executing the MiniZinc model, assuming the parsing issue would be resolved:**

### 1. Overview

*   **MiniZinc Model:** `word_embedding_inference.mzn`
*   **Data Files:** `minizinc_data/word_embeddings_chunk_0.dzn` to `minizinc_data/word_embeddings_chunk_2763.dzn` (total 2764 chunks).
*   **MiniZinc Executable:** `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/build/minizinc`

### 2. Estimated Size and Complexity

*   **Per Chunk:** Each chunk contains up to 100 words and their 8D embeddings.
    *   A typical chunk will have:
        *   `num_words`: up to 100
        *   `word_map`: an array of up to 100 strings
        *   `embeddings`: a 2D array of `100 x 8` floating-point numbers.
*   **Total Data Size:** With 2764 chunks, the total number of words processed is approximately `2764 * 100 = 276,400` words (this is an upper bound, as the last chunk might be smaller). Each word has an 8D embedding.
*   **Model Complexity:** The `word_embedding_inference.mzn` model calculates Euclidean distances between specified word pairs and optimizes embeddings. The complexity of the MiniZinc model itself depends on the number of variables and constraints. Since the goal is incremental solving, each MiniZinc run will only process one chunk at a time, keeping the per-run complexity manageable.

### 3. Estimated Runtime

*   **Per Chunk:** The runtime for a single chunk (100 words, 8D embeddings) is expected to be relatively fast, likely in the order of **seconds to tens of seconds**, depending on the MiniZinc solver's efficiency and the specific constraints/objectives within `word_embedding_inference.mzn`.
*   **Total Runtime (Iterative):** Since there are 2764 chunks, and assuming each chunk takes `X` seconds, the total estimated runtime would be `2764 * X` seconds.
    *   If `X` is 5 seconds, total runtime is `2764 * 5 = 13820 seconds` (approx 3.8 hours).
    *   If `X` is 10 seconds, total runtime is `2764 * 10 = 27640 seconds` (approx 7.6 hours).
    *   This is a significant total runtime, highlighting the need for incremental solving and potentially parallel processing if possible.

### 4. Orchestration for Incremental Solving (What we *would* run)

The process would involve a loop, likely managed by a shell script or a Rust program, that performs the following steps for each chunk:

1.  **Select Chunk:** Identify the next `word_embeddings_chunk_X.dzn` file to process.
2.  **Prepare MiniZinc Command:** Construct the MiniZinc command:
    ```bash
    /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/build/minizinc \
        /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/word_embedding_inference.mzn \
        /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/minizinc_data/word_embeddings_chunk_X.dzn \
        /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/minizinc_data/data_declarations.mzn \
        -s # (or other solver flags for optimization/output)
    ```
3.  **Execute MiniZinc:** Run the command.
4.  **Process Output:** Capture and parse the output from MiniZinc. This output would contain the optimized embeddings for the words in the current chunk.
5.  **Update Global Embeddings:** Integrate the newly optimized embeddings into a persistent global store (e.g., a database, or a new consolidated `.dzn` file). This step is crucial for the "warm-start" and iterative refinement mentioned in the overall plan.
6.  **Pass Warm-Start Data (Future):** For subsequent chunks, the MiniZinc model would need to be modified to accept previously optimized embeddings as fixed parameters, allowing the solver to focus on optimizing new words while respecting existing relationships. This would involve passing additional `.dzn` files or parameters to MiniZinc.
