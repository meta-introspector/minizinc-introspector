# Vibe/Meme: The Ordinal Translator 🔢

## Concept: `narrative_stage_to_int` Function

## Purpose
To convert a `NarrativeStage` enum value to its corresponding prime integer index. This function acts as a bridge between the symbolic, qualitative stages of a narrative and their quantitative, irreducible prime-ordered positions. It provides a numerical lens through which to track progression along a defined path, where each step is an irreducible semantic dimension.
