% File: llvm_blockchain_mesh_conceptual_v2.mzn
% Purpose: Conceptual MiniZinc model for LLVM IR splicing and ABI in hybrid blockchain GPU/CPU mesh networks.
% Version 2: Enhanced with more detailed network parameters and emergent properties.

% --- Network Parameters (Conceptual) ---
int: num_nodes = 5; % Number of nodes in the mesh network
enum NODE_TYPE = {CPU, GPU, BlockchainNode};
array[1..num_nodes] of var NODE_TYPE: node_types;

int: num_layers = 2; % Number of layers in the mesh network (conceptual)
int: connectivity_density = 50; % Percentage of possible connections (0-100)

% --- LLVM IR Splicing (Conceptual) ---
% Represents points where IR is spliced or adapted
set of int: SPLICING_POINTS = 1..3; % Example: 1=CPU-GPU, 2=Host-Device, 3=Cross-ABI
array[SPLICING_POINTS] of var bool: splicing_active;

% --- ABI Unification (Conceptual) ---
% Represents the degree of ABI compatibility
var float: abi_compatibility_score; % 0.0 (no compatibility) to 1.0 (full compatibility)
constraint abi_compatibility_score >= 0.0 /\ abi_compatibility_score <= 1.0;

% --- Self-Similarity (Conceptual) ---
% Relates to the embedding_dimension from previous models
var float: network_fractal_dimension; % Conceptual fractal dimension of the network topology
constraint network_fractal_dimension > 1.0 /\ network_fractal_dimension < 3.0;

% --- Emergent Properties (Conceptual) ---
var float: network_efficiency; % 0.0 (low) to 1.0 (high)
var float: data_throughput_gbps;
var int: security_level; % 1 (low) to 10 (high)

% --- Constraints (Conceptual) ---
% Example: Network fractal dimension is influenced by active networks
constraint if Blockchain in active_networks then network_fractal_dimension >= 2.0 else true endif;

% Example: Splicing is active if both CPU and GPU nodes are present
constraint if (exists(i in 1..num_nodes) (node_types[i] = CPU) /\ 
              exists(i in 1..num_nodes) (node_types[i] = GPU)) then
              splicing_active[1] = true else true endif;

% Example: Network fractal dimension is influenced by active networks
constraint if Blockchain in active_networks then network_fractal_dimension >= 2.0 else true endif;

% Example: Network efficiency is related to connectivity density
constraint network_efficiency = connectivity_density / 100.0;

% Example: Data throughput is related to GPU nodes and network bandwidth
% Note: gpu_memory_gb_agent and network_bandwidth_mbps_agent are assumed to be defined elsewhere or hardcoded
%       in DZN.
int: gpu_memory_gb_agent = 8; % Placeholder for now
int: network_bandwidth_mbps_agent = 100; % Placeholder for now
constraint data_throughput_gbps <= sum(i in 1..num_nodes where node_types[i] = GPU) (gpu_memory_gb_agent / 2.0
       ) + network_bandwidth_mbps_agent / 1000.0;

% Example: Security level is higher with more BlockchainNodes
constraint security_level = sum(i in 1..num_nodes where node_types[i] = BlockchainNode) (1) + 1;
constraint security_level <= 10;
