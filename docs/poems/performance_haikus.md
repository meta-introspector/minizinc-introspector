art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Efficiency," a sleek, glowing line of code moving swiftly and consuming minimal resources. For "Scalability," a system (perhaps a growing, luminous network) expanding effortlessly without strain. For "Performance," a burst of light and energy, with tasks completing in a blink. The overall feeling should be one of dynamic power, effortless speed, and the beauty of optimized systems.
