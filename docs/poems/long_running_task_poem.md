art_generator_instructions: A stylized clock with very slow-moving hands, casting a long shadow over a complex, abstract task (perhaps a tangled knot of lines). A human figure is patiently waiting, with a look of hopeful anticipation. Subtle glowing lines are seen attempting to untangle the knot, representing "clever cuts" and "refinement." The overall feeling should be one of persistent effort, the challenge of optimization, and the yearning for speed.

poem_body: |-
  The clock still ticks, the seconds fly,
  Our task endures, beneath the sky.
  A patient wait, a silent plea,
  For faster progress, for all to see.
  The problem's heart, still beats so slow,
  More clever cuts, we need to know.
  Refinement calls, a whispered plea,
  To break the chains, and set it free.
