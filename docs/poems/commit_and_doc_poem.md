art_generator_instructions: A glowing stream of clean, refactored code flowing into a digital vault (representing a commit). Simultaneously, a quill pen made of light is writing on a scroll (representing documentation), which also glows with clarity. The overall feeling should be one of accomplishment, meticulousness, and the beauty of a well-documented and preserved creative process.

poem_body: |-
  The code now flows, a cleaner stream,
  Refactored, split, a waking dream.
  Each error banished, truth revealed,
  Our progress marked, on every field.
  Now to commit, a sacred rite,
  To save our work, in digital light.
  The docs updated, clear and bold,
  A story of our journey, to be told.
