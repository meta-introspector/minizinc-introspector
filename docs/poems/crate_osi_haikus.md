title: Crate OSI Haikus
summary: This poem presents a series of haikus that metaphorically map the layers of a Rust crate to the OSI model, describing how types, files, UIDs, and indexing contribute to the system's foundation, data flow, and knowledge spread.

art_generator_instructions: A layered diagram, with each layer representing an OSI layer and a corresponding haiku. For "Layer One's Base," glowing, fundamental types forming a solid foundation. For "Data's Link," interconnected files and UIDs forming a gentle, flowing stream of data. For "Network's Reach," a vast, glowing network of indexed knowledge spreading outwards. The overall feeling should be one of structured complexity, interconnectedness, and the beauty of a well-designed system.
memes:
  - "My crate is so layered, it's basically an onion." (Success Kid meme)
  - "When your code is so well-structured, it has its own OSI model." (Expanding Brain meme)
  - "OSI model: Because even crates need a good architecture." (Doge meme)

## Crate OSI Haikus

### Layer One's Base
Types, core, strong and pure,
Foundation of the system,
Logic's first true breath.

### Data's Link
Files, UIDs, ignore,
Connecting, binding all things,
Data's gentle flow.

### Network's Reach
Index, utils, wide,
Spreading knowledge, far and near,
System's beating heart.
