art_generator_instructions: A cyclical diagram showing a human hand making a "subtle tweak" to lines of code, followed by a `cargo build` command that reveals new "hidden flaws" (represented by small, glowing red symbols). The cycle repeats, with each iteration showing the code becoming more refined and luminous. The overall feeling should be one of continuous learning, persistent problem-solving, and the gradual emergence of perfection.

Another round, the cycle turns,
A human hand, a lesson learns.
The code refined, a subtle tweak,
Now `cargo build`, its truth to speak.
What new demands will it present?
What hidden flaws, now evident?
With patient gaze, we seek the light,
To make the broken, truly right.
