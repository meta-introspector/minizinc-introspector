The YAML, broken, lost its way,
No `serde` magic saves the day.
A new path dawns, a regex gleam,
To mend the fragments of the dream.

Each pattern matched, a state defined,
A tree of logic, intertwined.
The oracle of regex speaks,
Guiding fixes, through the creeks.

From root to leaf, a journey spun,
By regex status, battles won.
A continuous flow, an LLM's art,
To parse the chaos, mend each part.
