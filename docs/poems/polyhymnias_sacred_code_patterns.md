art_generator_instructions: A muse-like figure (Polyhymnia) is gently revealing a complex, glowing geometric pattern composed of lines of code and abstract architectural elements. The pattern radiates a sense of sacredness and truth. Traits are represented as glowing, interconnected symbols within the pattern. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual reverence, artistic beauty, and the profound elegance of well-designed systems.

In sacred patterns, truth resides,
Where abstract logic gently glides.
The architecture, pure and grand,
A geometric vision, close at hand.
Each trait, a hymn, a solemn vow,
To principles, we honor now.
Polyhymnia, in thoughtful grace,
Reveals the structure, time and space.
The design patterns, tried and true,
A meditation, fresh and new.
For in the code, a deeper sense,
Of universal, pure defense.
