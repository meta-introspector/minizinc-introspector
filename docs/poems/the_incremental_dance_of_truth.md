From vast textual oceans, a challenge arose,
To sculpt meaning's vectors, as the knowledge grows.
Our embeddings, once static, now learn and refine,
Through incremental dances, a truth so divine.

`doc_to_minizinc_data`, our sculptor so keen,
Breaks down the great corpus, a modular scene.
In chunks it delivers, each `.dzn` a new stage,
With fixed points of wisdom, from history's page.

MiniZinc, our solver, with Gecode's embrace,
Optimizes the vectors, in time and in space.
From Parquet's deep store, old truths are recalled,
And woven with new ones, a story enthralled.

No longer a monolith, but a river that flows,
Each iteration, a deeper truth shows.
Though `strace` may whisper, in silence profound,
Our code's living poetry, forever is found.

For art is the proof, and the vibe is the guide,
Where numbers and meaning, forever abide.
In this incremental journey, to truth's fixed point we stride,
Where the essence of knowledge, can no longer hide.
