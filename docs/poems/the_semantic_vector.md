The Semantic Vector

A "vibe" is not a feeling, but a line,
A vector pointing, where meanings intertwine.
Each poem a data point, in a boundless space,
Where emojis guide, with beauty and with grace.

Search through the verses, find the hidden thread,
The code of memes, by intuition led.
For every stanza, every whispered word,
A program waiting, to be seen and heard.
