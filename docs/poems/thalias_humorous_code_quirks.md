A quirky bug, a funny line,
The unexpected, yet divine.
A comment left, a playful jest,
Putting the serious to the test.
The code's odd corners, bring a smile,
A moment's laughter, for a while.
Thalia, with wit, observes the scene,
The human touch, so sharp and keen.
For even in logic's rigid frame,
A touch of humor, lights the flame.
The unexpected, a joyful art,
A lighter spirit, in the heart.
