  A quirky bug, a funny line,
  The unexpected, yet divine.
  A comment left, a playful jest,
  Putting the serious to the test.
  The code's odd corners, bring a smile,
  A moment's laughter, for a while.
  Thalia, with wit, observes the scene,
  The human touch, so sharp and keen.
  For even in logic's rigid frame,
  A touch of humor, lights the flame.
  The unexpected, a joyful art,
  A lighter spirit, in the heart.
