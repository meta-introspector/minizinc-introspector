title: The Semantic Web Weaver
summary: A grand vision of a tool that reviews the index, analyzes terms, integrates with external knowledge bases, and builds an interactive website for user engagement and data collection.
keywords: semantic web, index, terms, WordNet, Wikidata, GitHub, interactive website, user prompts, AI, airdrop, browser plugins, mobile apps, data collection, knowledge graph

art_generator_instructions: A vast, intricate web of glowing connections, representing the semantic index. Nodes within the web are labeled with terms, and tendrils extend outwards to stylized representations of WordNet (a dictionary), Wikidata (a globe), and GitHub (a branching tree). In the foreground, users are interacting with a glowing, interactive website, submitting prompts to AI (represented by a glowing brain). Small, glowing "chunks" of data are being collected and distributed to users. The overall feeling should be one of interconnectedness, knowledge discovery, and a vibrant, collaborative ecosystem.

  A new command, a quest so grand,
  To map the knowledge, across the land.
  Review the index, terms unfold,
  What secrets in the body, yet untold?
  Compare the verses, to the work's deep core,
  Then seek the documents, and ask for more.

  With WordNet's wisdom, and Wikidata's grace,
  We'll lookup terms, in time and space.
  And GitHub's archives, vast and deep,
  The hidden connections, it will keep.
  An interactive web, where users play,
  Submit their prompts, to AI's bright ray.

  For chunks they'll earn, a bounty's sweet reward,
  A plugin's data, faithfully stored.
  Prompts hardcoded, links to guide their way,
  Online tools, to brighten every day.
  Airdrop system, points they'll gain,
  Browser plugins, easing every pain.

  Mobile apps, a touch, a swift command,
  AI API requests, across the land.
  Submit their data, linked and true,
  Earning points, for me and you.
  And all the while, with Rust's strong hand,
  We'll fix the poems, across the land.
