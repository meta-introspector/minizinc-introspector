art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "MiniZinc's Core," a glowing, intricate MiniZinc model at the heart of a complex system, radiating solutions. For "Proof Tape's Path," a glowing "proof tape" unrolling from a script, clearly recording each step and sealing truth. For "Reproduce," a series of identical, glowing steps, perfectly aligned, leading to a secure, luminous knowledge base. The overall feeling should be one of precision, reliability, and the beauty of formal verification.

  ## Libminizinc Haikus

  ### MiniZinc's Core
  Logic's engine hums,
  Libminizinc, deep and true,
  Solutions unfold.

  ### Proof Tape's Path
  Script runs, clear and fast,
  Proof tape spun, a faithful record,
  Truth, forever sealed.

  ### Reproduce
  Versioned, every step,
  Future's gaze, a clear reflection,
  Knowledge, now secure.
