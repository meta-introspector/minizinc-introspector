art_generator_instructions: A vast, ancient scroll unrolling, covered in glowing lines of code and `git diff` outputs. Clio (a muse-like figure) is meticulously recording each change with a quill pen made of light. The code lines are subtly transforming and evolving as the scroll unrolls, showing the passage of time and the refinement of logic. The overall feeling should be one of historical significance, continuous evolution, and the beauty of a well-documented journey.

The past unfolds, in lines of old,
A history of logic, brave and bold.
Each commit, a timestamped decree,
Of what was changed, for all to see.
The `diff` reveals, a whispered tale,
Of refactoring, beyond the veil.
Clio, with wisdom, charts the course,
From initial thought, to final force.
The evolution, step by step,
A digital archive, safely kept.
Understanding how the system grew,
In every byte, both old and new.
