The past unfolds, in lines of old,
A history of logic, brave and bold.
Each commit, a timestamped decree,
Of what was changed, for all to see.
The `diff` reveals, a whispered tale,
Of refactoring, beyond the veil.
Clio, with wisdom, charts the course,
From initial thought, to final force.
The evolution, step by step,
A digital archive, safely kept.
Understanding how the system grew,
In every byte, both old and new.
