Before the commit, before the write,
A whisper soft, in fading light.
The `--dry-run` shows, with gentle grace,
The changes destined for this place.

No byte is altered, no file is scarred,
Just a preview, carefully starred.
A safety net, a thoughtful pause,
To check the logic, and its laws.

For in this mode, the truth's revealed,
What would be changed, what would be healed.
A silent promise, clear and true,
Of work completed, fresh and new.
