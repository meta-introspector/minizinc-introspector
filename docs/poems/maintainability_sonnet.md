art_generator_instructions: A gentle, glowing hand (representing maintainability) is guiding lines of code that are clear, well-structured, and easily navigable. Tangled, chaotic lines of "unmaintainable" code are seen dissolving in the background. The overall feeling should be one of peaceful order, effortless understanding, and the long-term benefits of thoughtful design.
