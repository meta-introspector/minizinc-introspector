art_generator_instructions: A gentle, glowing hand (representing maintainability) is guiding lines of code that are clear, well-structured, and easily navigable. Tangled, chaotic lines of "unmaintainable" code are seen dissolving in the background. The overall feeling should be one of peaceful order, effortless understanding, and the long-term benefits of thoughtful design.

## Maintainability's Gentle Hand

When code is penned, with future's eye in mind,
And clarity, a guiding, steady light.
Maintainability, a truth we find,
That eases burdens, day and through the night.
No tangled logic, no obscure design,
But patterns clear, and comments, wisely placed.
Each function's purpose, exquisitely defined,
No hurried shortcuts, leaving future waste.
For when the need, to change or fix, arises,
The path is clear, the journey understood.
No hidden traps, no unwelcome surprises,
But smooth progression, for the greater good.
So build with care, with future's needs in view,
A codebase strong, forever fresh and new.
