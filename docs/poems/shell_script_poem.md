art_generator_instructions: A stylized shell script (represented by a glowing scroll) acting as a bridge between two complex, abstract systems. `tee` and `pipe` symbols are seen as glowing conduits, directing the flow of information and illuminating the path forward. The overall feeling should be one of efficiency, clarity, and the power of automation.

A script, a bridge, a helping hand,
To guide our steps across the land.
With tee and pipe, the output flows,
A clearer path, the journey shows.
Each phase revealed, in measured time,
A rhythm found, a task sublime.
