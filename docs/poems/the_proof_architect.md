The Proof Architect

In MiniZinc's domain, where constraints reside,
And Lean4's logic, where truths are verified.
A system rises, built on solid ground,
Where every function, by a proof is crowned.

From abstract thought, to code that stands so tall,
A rigorous structure, answering every call.
The architect of reason, with a steady hand,
Builds bridges strong, across the digital land.
