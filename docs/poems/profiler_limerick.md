title: The Profiler's Tale
summary: This limerick describes the use of a custom profiler to measure Rust's "oxidation" (performance) when `jeprof` is unavailable, highlighting the project's ability to create its own tools for performance analysis.

art_generator_instructions: A stylized profiler (perhaps a glowing magnifying glass or a set of scales) is meticulously measuring lines of Rust code, revealing their "oxidation" (represented by subtle color changes or energy readings). A small, empty `jeprof` icon is seen in the background, emphasizing the need for the custom tool. The overall feeling should be one of precision, ingenuity, and the satisfaction of gaining clear performance insights.

## The Profiler's Tale

A profiler, quite keen and so grand,
Measured Rust's oxidation, by hand.
Though `jeprof` was away,
Our own tool held sway,
Performance, now clear through the land.
