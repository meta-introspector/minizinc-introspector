art_generator_instructions: A large, imposing problem (perhaps a dark, abstract shape) is being systematically split into smaller, glowing pieces by a series of precise cuts. Each split reveals a clearer, more luminous structure, leading to a sense of order and accomplishment. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual precision, methodical progress, and the beauty of breaking down complexity.

poem_body: |-
  The giant problem, still too vast,
  A shadow on our path is cast.
  But wisdom whispers, soft and low,
  Divide and conquer, watch it grow.
  In halves we cleave, with careful hand,
  Until ten seconds grace the land.
  Each smaller piece, a victory won,
  Our grand design, beneath the sun.
