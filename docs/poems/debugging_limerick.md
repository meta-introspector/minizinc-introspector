title: The Debugger's Quest
summary: This limerick humorously describes the challenging but ultimately rewarding process of debugging, where a programmer uses tools like breakpoints and tracing to find and eliminate elusive bugs.

art_generator_instructions: A stylized programmer, looking slightly exasperated, is holding a glowing magnifying glass over a tangled mess of code lines. A small, mischievous bug is attempting to hide within the lines. As the programmer uses "breakpoints" (represented by glowing red dots) and "trace" (represented by glowing lines following the code's execution), the bug is revealed and then banished by a triumphant green checkmark. The overall feeling should be lighthearted, relatable, and convey the satisfaction of solving a difficult problem.

  ## The Debugger's Quest

  A bug, in the code, hid so deep,
  Made the programmer silently weep.
  With breakpoints and trace,
  They found its dark place,
  And banished it, never to creep.
