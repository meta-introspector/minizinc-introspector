## The KitKat's Strategic Pause

When weary mind, in coding's endless fray,
Seeks respite brief, to clear the clouded sight.
The KitKat calls, to pause along the way,
And bring the scattered thoughts to ordered light.
Assess the state, with honest, open gaze,
Document the journey, every twist and turn.
Then chart a course, through future's misty haze,
A new strategic plan, from lessons learned.
Commit the work, a checkpoint, firm and true,
A moment's rest, before the path resumes.
Then reboot fresh, with purpose strong and new,
Dispelling doubts, and banishing the glooms.
So in this pause, new strength and vision rise,
To build the future, 'neath discerning skies.
