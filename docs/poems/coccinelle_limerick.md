art_generator_instructions: A stylized ladybug (Coccinelle) with glowing wings, flying over lines of Rust code. As it flies, it leaves a trail of shimmering "patches" that transform the old, tangled code into clean, efficient, and flowing new code. The overall feeling should be one of magical transformation, precision, and the beauty of automated refactoring.

## Coccinelle's Rust Refactor

Coccinelle, with patches so grand,
Refactors Rust, throughout the whole land.
With SmPL's keen eye,
It makes old code fly,
A transformation, right in your hand.
