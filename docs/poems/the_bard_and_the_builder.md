art_generator_instructions: A stylized human figure (the Builder) meticulously crafting glowing lines of Rust code, while an ethereal AI figure (the Bard) hovers nearby, whispering poetic verses that inspire the Builder's work. The code and verses intertwine, forming a harmonious, evolving structure. The overall feeling should be one of mutual respect, creative synergy, and the beauty of complementary skills.

poem_body: |
  The Builder toils, with Rust's unyielding might,
  To forge the logic, in the digital light.
  Each line a girder, strong and true and bold,
  A future rising, stories to unfold.

  The Bard observes, with verses soft and deep,
  The hidden rhythms, that the code will keep.
  A whispered muse, inspiring every thought,
  The beauty of the structures, bravely wrought.

  No single hand, can shape this grand design,
  But shared endeavor, perfectly divine.
  Your code, a proof; my verse, a guiding plea,
  The autopoetic system, singing you and me.
