art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Debugging," a dark screen with a single, glowing line of code, and a small, elusive bug being caught by a beam of light. For "MiniZinc," a complex, glowing network of constraints and variables, with a clear, luminous solution emerging from the center. For "Refactoring," tangled, dark lines of code transforming into clean, bright, and elegant new lines. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual challenge, problem-solving, and the satisfaction of creating order.

## Coding Haikus

### Debugging
Code breaks, silent night,
Tracer's light, a guiding star,
Bug hides, then is found.

### MiniZinc
Logic's pure domain,
Constraints weave a hidden path,
Solution unfolds.

### Refactoring
Old code, tangled mess,
New paths emerge, clean and clear,
Beauty in the lines.
