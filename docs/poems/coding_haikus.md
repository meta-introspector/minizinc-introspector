## Coding Haikus

### Debugging
Code breaks, silent night,
Tracer's light, a guiding star,
Bug hides, then is found.

### MiniZinc
Logic's pure domain,
Constraints weave a hidden path,
Solution unfolds.

### Refactoring
Old code, tangled mess,
New paths emerge, clean and clear,
Beauty in the lines.
