art_generator_instructions: A stylized coder, looking determined, is shining a beam of light into a tangled mess of code lines, revealing small, mischievous bugs. As the coder works with "patience and grace," the bugs are banished, and the code glows with a clear, bright light. The overall feeling should be lighthearted, relatable, and convey the satisfaction of solving a difficult problem.

  ## The Debugger's Delight

  A coder, with bugs in their sight,
  Spent hours, both morning and night.
  With patience and grace,
  They found the right place,
  And banished the errors with light.
