art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Reboot's Dawn," a stylized system booting up, with a glowing thread leading towards a clear, illuminated path. For "Git's Embrace," a glowing `git log` output with subtle whispers emanating from the patches. For "Forward March," a determined figure moving swiftly forward, with a clear purpose. The overall feeling should be one of efficiency, clarity, and focused progress.

## GM Meta-Program Haikus

### Reboot's Dawn
System wakes anew,
Memory's path, a guiding thread,
Critical path, clear.

### Git's Embrace
Logs unfold the past,
Patches whisper, soft and low,
Journey, understood.

### Forward March
No time for delay,
Focus sharp, with purpose true,
Progress, day by day.
