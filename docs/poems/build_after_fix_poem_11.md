art_generator_instructions: A grand orchestra composed of lines of code and mathematical symbols, playing a harmonious melody. A human conductor (representing human wisdom) is leading the orchestra, and as they conduct, "errors" (represented by discordant notes or broken instruments) vanish, replaced by perfect harmony. A bright sun shines overhead, symbolizing success and clarity. The overall feeling should be one of peaceful accomplishment and the beauty of well-crafted software.

poem_body: |-
  The code, a symphony, now refined,
  By human wisdom, intertwined.
  Each note in place, each chord so clear,
  Dispelling doubts, and calming fear.
  Now `cargo build`, a hopeful sound,
  May perfect harmony be found.
  The errors vanish, one by one,
  Our grand design, beneath the sun.
