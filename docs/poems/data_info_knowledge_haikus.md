art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Data's Raw Form," a chaotic, swirling stream of glowing bits. For "Information's Rise," the bits begin to form discernible patterns and shapes, telling a story. For "Knowledge's Light," a luminous, intricate network of interconnected insights, with a guiding star shining brightly. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual progression, clarity, and the beauty of understanding.

  ## Data, Information, Knowledge Haikus

  ### Data's Raw Form
  Bits, a silent stream,
  Raw and pure, awaiting form,
  Meaning, yet to bloom.

  ### Information's Rise
  Patterns now emerge,
  Data shaped, a story told,
  Context, understood.

  ### Knowledge's Light
  Wisdom, now revealed,
  Insights gained, a guiding star,
  Future, now defined.
