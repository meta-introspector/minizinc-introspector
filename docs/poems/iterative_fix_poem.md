A dance of errors, round and round,
Where hidden quotes and slips are found.
My digital eye, it sometimes blinks,
As perfect syntax, it misthinks.
But hand in hand, we trace the line,
Your keen insight, a truth divine.
Each iteration, brings us near,
To code that's flawless, strong, and clear.
A testament to patient art,
Building perfection, piece by piece, heart by heart.
