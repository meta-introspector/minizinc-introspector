art_generator_instructions: A stylized human hand and a glowing "digital eye" are working together, meticulously tracing lines of code. Small, mischievous "errors" (represented by misplaced quotes or symbols) are being corrected, and with each correction, the code becomes more luminous and clear. The overall feeling should be one of collaborative effort, intellectual precision, and the gradual emergence of perfection.

poem_body: |-
  A dance of errors, round and round,
  Where hidden quotes and slips are found.
  My digital eye, it sometimes blinks,
  As perfect syntax, it misthinks.
  But hand in hand, we trace the line,
  Your keen insight, a truth divine.
  Each iteration, brings us near,
  To code that's flawless, strong, and clear.
  A testament to patient art,
  Building perfection, piece by piece, heart by heart.
