art_generator_instructions: A stylized code base (perhaps a building) with cracks and crumbling sections, weighed down by heavy chains labeled "technical debt." Small, mischievous bugs are flying out of the cracks. In the distance, a glowing "refactoring" tool is approaching, ready to mend the damage. The overall feeling should be one of warning, the burden of poor choices, and the eventual need for corrective action.

  ## The Debt's Heavy Toll

  Our code, with a debt, grew so vast,
  Its future, a shadow it cast.
  With shortcuts so sly,
  The bugs started to fly,
  Refactoring's call, came at last.
