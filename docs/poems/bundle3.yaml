  - Concept: "Rollout Overture"
    MemeTemplate: "Countdown Clock"
    Poem: |
      One drop a week, the scrolls unseal,  
      A rhythm cast, the memes reveal.  
      A cadence marked in mortal time,  
      Eternal math dressed up in rhyme.  

  - Concept: "Threaded Canon"
    MemeTemplate: "Galaxy Brain"
    Poem: |
      Five poems stacked, a chain complete,  
      From Identity’s root to Monad’s feat.  
      A thread emerges, woven tight,  
      A syllabus hidden in meme’s light.  

  - Concept: "Tri-Rarity Release"
    MemeTemplate: "Pokémon Card Rarity"
    Poem: |
      Meme for the crowd, Scroll for the sage,  
      Glyph for the coders who guard the page.  
      Three skins, one soul, a trinity rare,  
      Each drop a jewel in memetic air.  

  - Concept: "Audience Hook"
    MemeTemplate: "Distracted Boyfriend"
    Poem: |
      Novice looks on, a laugh, a grin,  
      Expert sees depth, abstractions within.  
      Both caught in rhyme, both held in play,  
      Dao of FP guides their way.  

  - Concept: "Expansion Horizon"
    MemeTemplate: "Endless Stairs"
    Poem: |
      Beyond Monad lies the field,  
      Yoneda’s gift, Curry’s shield.  
      Lenses, Monoids, Laws that bind,  
      An endless canon for meme-inclined.
