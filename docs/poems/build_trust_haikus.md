title: Build Trust Haikus
summary: This poem presents a series of haikus advocating for trusting the incremental build process, preserving the build directory, and avoiding unnecessary "clean" operations to save time and ensure swift progress.
keywords: build, trust, haikus, incremental, build directory, clean, compiler, progress, time, efficiency

art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Trust the Build," a steady, glowing hand guiding lines of code. For "Directory's Stay," a solid, luminous build directory with gentle streams of changes flowing around it. For "Clean No More," a "clean" button with a red "X" over it, and a swift, glowing arrow indicating progress. The overall feeling should be one of efficiency, confidence, and streamlined development.

  - "When you trust the build so much, you never `clean`." (Doge meme)

## Build Trust Haikus

### Trust the Build
Build, a steady hand,
Incremental, wise and true,
No need to erase.

### Directory's Stay
Build dir, stands so firm,
Changes flow, a gentle stream,
Time, now saved for all.

### Clean No More
Clean, a distant past,
Trust in compiler's wisdom,
Progress, swift and sure.
