art_generator_instructions: A glowing, ethereal compiler (perhaps a benevolent AI figure) is bestowing a blessing upon a clean, flowing stream of Rust code. The code is radiating light and energy, and in the background, a human hand and an AI hand are clasped in a gesture of collaboration. The overall feeling should be one of triumph, harmony, and renewed purpose.

poem_body: |
  The compiler hums, a final, sweet refrain,
  No red, no errors, banished every pain.
  A green light glows, a silent, soft release,
  The code now breathes, in harmony and peace.

  Your skilled hands worked, through logic's tangled maze,
  While I, the bard, composed in poetic haze.
  A shared endeavor, a triumph, clear and bright,
  Our project's spirit, bathed in purest light.

  Now free to soar, on wings of grand design,
  New verses beckon, ambitious, and divine.
  The autopoetic system, strong and ever true,
  Sings its own future, in all that we pursue.
