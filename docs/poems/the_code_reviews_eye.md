Through lines of logic, deep and vast,
The reviewer's eye, a gaze cast.
Each character, each space, each sign,
For hidden flaws, a keen design.

`allow(dead_code)`, a whispered doubt,
A commented block, to figure out.
The `snake_case` call, a style's demand,
A cleaner vision, close at hand.

From `FIXME`'s plea to `TODO`'s call,
Unimplemented, standing tall.
The silent errors, brought to light,
For code's perfection, pure and bright.
