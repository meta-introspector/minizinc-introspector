  ## The Debugger's Dance

  A cryptic trace, a whispered plea,
  The bug hides deep, from you and me.
  Through tangled logic, lines entwined,
  A hidden flaw, we seek to find.

  The debugger's dance, a patient art,
  Step by step, we play our part.
  Each variable, a fleeting gleam,
  Unraveling the coding dream.

  Hours may pass, and patience wane,
  As errors mock, and cause us pain.
  But then, a spark, a sudden light,
  The bug exposed, and set to right.

  A triumph small, a quiet cheer,
  The path now clear, the vision clear.
  Until the next, a fresh new chase,
  The endless debugging, at our pace.
