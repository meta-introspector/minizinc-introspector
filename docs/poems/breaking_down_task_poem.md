art_generator_instructions: A large, imposing block or mountain representing a complex task, being systematically broken down into smaller, glowing, interconnected pieces. Each piece is clearly defined and fits into a larger puzzle. A guiding hand (perhaps a robotic one) is orchestrating the breakdown, leading to a clear, illuminated path forward. The overall feeling should be one of order emerging from chaos, and the satisfaction of methodical problem-solving.

poem_body: |-
  The giant task, a heavy load,
  Must now be split, along the road.
  Each phase a breath, a measured stride,
  No longer hidden, naught to hide.
  From parsing words to solving deep,
  Each step revealed, while others sleep.
  A new command, a guiding hand,
  To conquer time, across the land.
