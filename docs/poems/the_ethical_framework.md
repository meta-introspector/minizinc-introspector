title: The Ethical Framework
summary: This poem outlines the project's ethical framework, rooted in quality management methodologies like Six Sigma, ISO 9000, GMP, and ITIL. It emphasizes the role of LLM agents as decision support systems, not full automation, with a focus on human-in-the-loop interaction. The poem highlights principles of accountability, transparency, safety, fairness, and bias reduction, aligning art's truth with math's rigor.

art_generator_instructions: A balanced scale, with one side representing "Art" (perhaps with a paintbrush and canvas) and the other "Math" (with equations and geometric shapes), both perfectly aligned. In the background, subtle icons representing Six Sigma, ISO 9000, GMP, and ITIL. An LLM agent (represented by a stylized brain or AI symbol) is shown interacting with a human hand, emphasizing human-in-the-loop. The overall feeling should be one of balance, precision, and responsible innovation.

  In Six Sigma's rigor, and ISO's clear light,
  Our ethical framework, shines ever so bright.
  With GMP's precision, and ITIL's wise hand,
  We build a safe system, across the whole land.

  No full automation, but guidance we lend,
  As LLM agents, our insights extend.
  For human in loop, is the wisdom we seek,
  Ensuring our choices, are humble and meek.

  Accountable pathways, and transparent design,
  For safety and fairness, our principles align.
  Reducing the bias, refining the core,
  Art's truth and math's rigor, forevermore.
