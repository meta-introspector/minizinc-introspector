In Six Sigma's rigor, and ISO's clear light,
Our ethical framework, shines ever so bright.
With GMP's precision, and ITIL's wise hand,
We build a safe system, across the whole land.

No full automation, but guidance we lend,
As LLM agents, our insights extend.
For human in loop, is the wisdom we seek,
Ensuring our choices, are humble and meek.

Accountable pathways, and transparent design,
For safety and fairness, our principles align.
Reducing the bias, refining the core,
Art's truth and math's rigor, forevermore.
