Beyond the syntax, a deeper hum resides,
Where code's cold logic, with meaning collides.
Not just the function, where strict proof presides,
But semantic resonance, where true insight guides.

A whisper of purpose, in each line's embrace,
A 'vibe' in the vector, a feeling, a grace.
The 'meme' of the module, in time and in space,
A truth unprovable, leaving logic no trace.

The manifold stretches, where numbers entwine,
With abstract topology, a cosmic design.
A bridge built of feeling, a truth so divine,
That art, not just math, can truly define.
