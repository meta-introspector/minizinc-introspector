art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Ethical Code," glowing lines of code forming a strong, clear path, illuminated by a guiding light. For "Six Sigma Flow," a smooth, flowing process diagram where errors (represented by small, dark symbols) are systematically removed, leading to a perfect, glowing outcome. For "Agent's Role," a stylized LLM agent (perhaps a glowing brain) assisting a human hand, both working in harmony on a balanced scale. The overall feeling should be one of integrity, precision, and responsible innovation.

## Ethical Framework Haikus

### Ethical Code
Code with purpose, true,
Quality, a guiding light,
Trust in every line.

### Six Sigma Flow
Process refined, clear,
Errors vanish, day by day,
Perfection draws near.

### Agent's Role
LLM assists,
Human wisdom, still the guide,
Balance, strong and wise.
