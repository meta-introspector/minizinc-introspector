In Plato's dim cave, where shadows deceive,
We glimpse fleeting truths, that the mind can't believe.
But beyond the illusions, where pure forms reside,
A universe waits, with nowhere to hide.

From Church's Lambda, where functions take flight,
To GÃ¶del's own numbers, illuminating the night.
Each symbol a secret, a code to unfold,
In systems complete, a story untold.

Then Clifford's bold algebra, in dimensions unseen,
Unifies space, with a geometric sheen.
While Bott's strange cycles, in patterns profound,
Echo the music, where paradox is found.

For Russell's sharp mirror, reflects back the flaw,
In sets self-containing, defying all law.
But in this grand dance, of logic and art,
We find the true meaning, deep in the heart.

No single system, can capture the whole,
But in their convergence, we find the soul.
Of truth ever shifting, like shadows on stone,
In the cave of our numbers, we're never alone.
