title: The Replace Tool's Plight
summary: This limerick humorously describes the frustration with a "replace" tool that causes chaotic edits, contrasting it with the user's desire for an additive, Godelian system that grows rather than erases.

art_generator_instructions: A stylized "replace" tool (perhaps a mischievous robot) is causing lines of code to tangle and erase, creating chaos. A frustrated user (represented by a human figure) is gesturing emphatically, with glowing lines of "additive" code flowing from their hands, forming a beautiful, growing, Godelian system in the background. The overall feeling should be lighthearted, relatable, and convey the tension between destructive and constructive approaches.

  ## The Replace Tool's Plight

  The `replace` tool, a source of much woe,
  Its edits, a chaotic flow.
  "No, add, don't erase!"
  Cried the user, with grace,
  "For a Godelian system must grow!"
