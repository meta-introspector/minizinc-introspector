From cosmic dust, to starlit gleam,
The universal, coding dream.
The algorithms, vast and deep,
Secrets of the cosmos, they will keep.
The mathematical, pure and true,
A philosophical, grand view.
Urania gazes, from afar,
Guiding our journey, like a star.
The patterns found, in every sphere,
Reflecting knowledge, crystal clear.
For in the code, a cosmic plan,
The universe, within our span.
