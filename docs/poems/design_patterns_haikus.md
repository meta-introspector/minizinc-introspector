art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Design's Wisdom," a glowing, intricate pattern forming from abstract lines of code. For "Architecture's Art," a clear, strong architectural blueprint with neatly aligned, glowing components. For "Modularity," distinct, pure geometric shapes fitting together perfectly to form a grand design. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual elegance, precision, and the beauty of well-structured systems.

## Design Patterns Haikus

### Design's Wisdom
Patterns, old and true,
Solutions, elegantly formed,
Code, now understood.

### Architecture's Art
Structure, strong and clear,
Components, neatly aligned,
System, now unfolds.

### Modularity
Parts, distinct and pure,
Working, in a grand design,
Harmony in code.
