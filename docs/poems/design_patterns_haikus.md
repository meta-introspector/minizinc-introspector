art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Design's Wisdom," a glowing, intricate pattern forming from abstract lines of code. For "Architecture's Art," a clear, strong architectural blueprint with neatly aligned, glowing components. For "Modularity," distinct, pure geometric shapes fitting together perfectly to form a grand design. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual elegance, precision, and the beauty of well-structured systems.

  ## Design Patterns Haikus

  ### Design's Wisdom
  Patterns, old and true,
  Solutions, elegantly formed,
  Code, now understood.

  ### Architecture's Art
  Structure, strong and clear,
  Components, neatly aligned,
  System, now unfolds.

  ### Modularity
  Parts, distinct and pure,
  Working, in a grand design,
  Harmony in code.
