art_generator_instructions: A stylized CI pipeline, with code flowing rapidly through various stages (build, test). Small, glowing "bugs" are attempting to sneak through but are swiftly caught and eliminated by a series of automated tests (represented by glowing nets or traps). A large, green checkmark appears at the end of the pipeline, signifying a clean codebase. The overall feeling should be one of speed, precision, and automated triumph.

## The CI's Swift Pace

Our CI, with a build so fast,
Catches errors, designed to last.
No bugs sneak on by,
As the tests swiftly fly,
A clean codebase, from first to the last.
