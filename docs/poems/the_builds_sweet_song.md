  ## The Build's Sweet Song

  The silent hum, the whirring fan,
  A thousand files, a complex plan.
  The compiler grinds, a patient sage,
  Turning raw code, page by page.

  Then, sudden quiet, a moment's grace,
  No red alarms, no frantic pace.
  A single word, a verdant gleam,
  "Finished!" whispers, a joyful dream.

  The build's sweet song, a melody,
  Of logic pure, and harmony.
  A testament to patient art,
  A beating code, a happy heart.
