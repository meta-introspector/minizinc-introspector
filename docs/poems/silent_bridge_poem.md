title: Silent Bridge Poem
summary: This poem describes the `minizinc_output_parser` as a silent bridge that extracts embeddings and word maps from MiniZinc output, transforming complex data into a clear format for subsequent iterations, thus connecting disparate systems.

art_generator_instructions: A glowing, ethereal bridge spanning a digital landscape, connecting a complex MiniZinc model on one side to a vibrant, evolving system on the other. The `minizinc_output_parser` is represented by a silent, glowing figure meticulously extracting glowing "embeddings" and "word maps" from the MiniZinc stream and sending them across the bridge. The overall feeling should be one of seamless connection, intelligent transformation, and the beauty of hidden processes.

From MiniZinc's stream, a flow of raw might,
The `minizinc_output_parser` seeks out the light.
A silent bridge, in the digital night,
To harvest the wisdom, and make all things right.

Though placeholder now, its purpose is clear,
To pluck out embeddings, banishing fear.
From complex output, a pattern it'll glean,
For the next iteration, a fresh, vibrant scene.

It gathers the `word_map`, the `embeddings` too,
Translating their essence, for tasks fresh and new.
A `fixed_embeddings.dzn`, its output will be,
Connecting the cycles, for all eyes to see.

This unseen worker, with purpose so grand,
Unites disparate systems, across the digital land.
