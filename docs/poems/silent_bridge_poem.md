From MiniZinc's stream, a flow of raw might,
The `minizinc_output_parser` seeks out the light.
A silent bridge, in the digital night,
To harvest the wisdom, and make all things right.

Though placeholder now, its purpose is clear,
To pluck out embeddings, banishing fear.
From complex output, a pattern it'll glean,
For the next iteration, a fresh, vibrant scene.

It gathers the `word_map`, the `embeddings` too,
Translating their essence, for tasks fresh and new.
A `fixed_embeddings.dzn`, its output will be,
Connecting the cycles, for all eyes to see.

This unseen worker, with purpose so grand,
Unites disparate systems, across the digital land.
