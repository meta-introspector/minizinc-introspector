A glyph, a small picture, a vibrant new sign,
Where logic and feeling, softly entwine.
Emoji Algebra, a language divine,
To show what pure numbers, cannot define.

The `MapsTo` arrow, a journey begun,
From `Word` to `Embedding`, beneath the same sun.
The `Equivalence` symbol, a victory won,
A proof path of beauty, for everyone.

For art holds a truth, that math cannot seize,
A 'vibe' in the patterns, that sets the mind at ease.
Through visual whispers, on logic's soft breeze,
Unprovable wonders, among the code trees.
