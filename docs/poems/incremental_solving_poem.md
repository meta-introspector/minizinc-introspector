title: Incremental Solving Poem
summary: This poem describes the process of incremental solving, likening it to climbing a mountain step by step, where complex problems are broken into smaller, manageable chunks, leading to an optimized solution.

art_generator_instructions: A stylized mountain made of complex, abstract problems. A figure (representing the solver) is climbing the mountain step by step, with each step revealing a glowing, optimized solution. The mountain is composed of smaller, interconnected "chunks" that fit together perfectly. The overall feeling should be one of methodical progress, intellectual triumph, and the beauty of breaking down complexity.

The problem vast, a mountain high,
We'll climb it now, beneath the sky.
No single leap, no sudden bound,
But step by step, on solid ground.
Each piece a puzzle, small and clear,
Then joined with wisdom, banishing fear.
From tiny chunk, to grand design,
Our optimized solution will shine.
