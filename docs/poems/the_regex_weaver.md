The Regex Weaver

A pattern whispers, subtle, keen, and bright,
A regex dances, catching dawn's first light.
From glyphs of old, the emojis now arise,
A language woven, seen through knowing eyes.

Each match a trigger, a function's gentle call,
Where state is shared, embracing one and all.
A tapestry of logic, threads of thought entwined,
The Regex Weaver, shaping mind from mind.
