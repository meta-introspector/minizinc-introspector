art_generator_instructions: A stylized code base (perhaps a building) with cracks and crumbling sections, weighed down by heavy chains labeled "technical debt." Small, mischievous bugs are flying out of the cracks, and the building is slowly sinking into a dark, tangled abyss. In the distance, a glowing "refactoring" tool is approaching, ready to mend the damage and bring light back to the scene. The overall feeling should be one of warning, the burden of poor choices, and the eventual need for corrective action.
