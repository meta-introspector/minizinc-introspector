## The Weight of Technical Debt

When hurried hands, in haste, lay down the code,
A silent burden, starts its slow accrue.
Technical debt, a heavy, unseen load,
That grows unseen, though problems are but few.
Each shortcut taken, each design ignored,
A future cost, that time will surely claim.
The codebase groans, its purpose now deplored,
A tangled mess, a whispered, bitter name.
Then comes the day, when progress starts to stall,
The features slow, the bugs begin to bite.
A refactoring call, to mend it all,
To bring the darkness, back into the light.
So pay the price, before it grows too vast,
For clean code's health, is built to truly last.
