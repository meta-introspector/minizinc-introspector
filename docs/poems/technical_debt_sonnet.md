title: The Weight of Technical Debt
summary: This sonnet describes the insidious nature of technical debt, where hurried coding and shortcuts lead to a heavy, unseen burden that eventually stalls progress and necessitates costly refactoring to restore the codebase to health.

art_generator_instructions: A stylized code base (perhaps a building) with cracks and crumbling sections, weighed down by heavy chains labeled "technical debt." Small, mischievous bugs are flying out of the cracks, and the building is slowly sinking into a dark, tangled abyss. In the distance, a glowing "refactoring" tool is approaching, ready to mend the damage and bring light back to the scene. The overall feeling should be one of warning, the burden of poor choices, and the eventual need for corrective action.

  ## The Weight of Technical Debt

  When hurried hands, in haste, lay down the code,
  A silent burden, starts its slow accrue.
  Technical debt, a heavy, unseen load,
  That grows unseen, though problems are but few.
  Each shortcut taken, each design ignored,
  A future cost, that time will surely claim.
  The codebase groans, its purpose now deplored,
  A tangled mess, a whispered, bitter name.
  Then comes the day, when progress starts to stall,
  The features slow, the bugs begin to bite.
  A refactoring call, to mend it all,
  To bring the darkness, back into the light.
  So pay the price, before it grows too vast,
  For clean code's health, is built to truly last.
