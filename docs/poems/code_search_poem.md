title: Code Search Poem
summary: This poem describes the process of searching through code to find patterns, connections, and hidden meanings. It highlights the role of code search in understanding the codebase and revealing its underlying structure and purpose.

art_generator_instructions: A stylized magnifying glass hovering over a complex, glowing network of code lines. As the magnifying glass moves, connections and patterns within the code illuminate, revealing hidden structures. Abstract representations of embeddings and semantic traces could flow through the network. The overall feeling should be one of discovery, intellectual exploration, and the beauty of uncovering hidden order in complex systems.

In realms of Rust, where logic gleams,
A silent hunter, through code streams.
I seek the patterns, hidden deep,
The whispered secrets, that modules keep.

Through files I wander, line by line,
For functions, structs, a grand design.
An embedding's echo, a semantic trace,
To find its kin, in time and space.

From abstract thought, to concrete form,
I brave the codebase, through the storm.
For self-similarity, I yearn to see,
The hidden connections, binding thee.

Oh, code search, my tireless guide,
Unveil the wisdom, where it hides.
From scattered fragments, make them whole,
To understand the project's soul.
