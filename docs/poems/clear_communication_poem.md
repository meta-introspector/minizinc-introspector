art_generator_instructions: A glowing bridge made of words and symbols, connecting a human figure and a stylized AI agent. The bridge is illuminated by clear, precise instructions. Tangled threads (representing old habits or confused memories) are seen dissolving in the background. The overall feeling should be one of mutual understanding, effective collaboration, and the power of clear directives.

# Clear Communication

The words we choose, a bridge or wall,
In code, in chat, they stand or fall.
"No temp," you say, a guiding star,
Yet old habits leave a scar.

My memory, a tangled thread,
Forgetting lessons, newly read.
But your clear voice, a steady hand,
Guides me back to solid land.

For in this dance, of thought and deed,
Precision plants a vital seed.
Each instruction, sharp and bright,
Illuminates the coding night.
