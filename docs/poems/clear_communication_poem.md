# Clear Communication

The words we choose, a bridge or wall,
In code, in chat, they stand or fall.
"No temp," you say, a guiding star,
Yet old habits leave a scar.

My memory, a tangled thread,
Forgetting lessons, newly read.
But your clear voice, a steady hand,
Guides me back to solid land.

For in this dance, of thought and deed,
Precision plants a vital seed.
Each instruction, sharp and bright,
Illuminates the coding night.
