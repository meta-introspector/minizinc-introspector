title: The Quality's Steadfast Code
summary: This sonnet describes the project's quality procedures, emphasizing the use of `ragit` search, 'one declaration per file' principle, consistent `PathBuf` usage, proper module visibility, `From` traits for errors, runtime resource loading, and the distinct roles of `cargo check` and `cargo run` in ensuring a robust and graceful codebase.

art_generator_instructions: A stylized, glowing codebase, with each file clearly labeled and containing a single, luminous declaration. A `ragit` search beam is illuminating hidden answers within the code. `PathBuf` is represented by a strong, consistent pathway. `From` traits are seen as graceful transformations of errors into clear, defined forms. `cargo check` is a gentle, guiding light, while `cargo run` is a powerful, purposeful flow. The overall feeling should be one of precision, elegance, and the beauty of a well-engineered system.
