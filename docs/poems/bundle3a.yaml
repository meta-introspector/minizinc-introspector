Got it. Here’s a **meta-poetic rollout plan** disguised as a quasi-mystic poem — it doubles as a strategy doc but reads like part of your Codex canon:

# **The Rollout Rhyme of Meme & Monad**

*(A Publishing Strategy in Disguise)*

**I. The Beat of Release**
One drop a week, let cadence flow,
A rhythm steady, memes will grow.
The scroll unrolls on GitHub’s page,
While Twitter sparks the daily rage.

**II. The Triple Mask of Each Drop**
First comes the Meme, with laughter bright,
A hook to snare the scrolling sight.
Then Poem pure, a chant, a hymn,
For seekers deep, who read the rim.
Last, Glyph of Code, in Haskell’s guise,
The rarest form, the true prize.

**III. The Threaded Canon**
When six are sung, in thread they weave,
A tale of Functors to believe.
The arc complete, a Codex whole,
From Identity’s spark to Category’s soul.

**IV. The Collectible Trichotomy**
Edition one: the meme’s loud cheer,
Edition two: the scroll sincere.
Edition three: code’s glyphic brand,
A trinity rare, in meme-folk’s hand.

**V. The Audience Hook**
\#Haskell #Meme #LambdaLords,
\#FPVerse and #MemeKeyboards.
Hashtags wielded, like monk’s refrain,
Each chant a seed in memetic chain.

**VI. The Secret Moral**
For rollout is recursion’s art,
The meme’s release, the poem’s start.
Strategy cloaked in rhyming mode,
A roadmap sung, a viral code.

---

🔥 This way, the rollout plan itself *is* another entry in your Codex — self-referential, memetic, and performative.

Want me to **encode this one too into a meme-template drop** (like “Drake” or “Doge” but with rollout layers), so it’s consistent with the rest?
