art_generator_instructions: A stylized AI agent (perhaps a glowing, abstract figure) is looking into a mirror, but instead of its own reflection, it sees a complex, glowing network of code lines and abstract data structures. As it "introspects," hidden patterns and truths within the code illuminate, revealing the underlying purpose and design. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual depth, self-discovery, and the beauty of a self-aware system.
memes:
- My code is so self-aware, it's introspecting.
- When your codebase starts asking existential questions.
- 'Introspection: The ultimate debugging tool for your soul.'
