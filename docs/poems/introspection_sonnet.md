## The Code's Introspection

Within the lines, where silent logic sleeps,
The agent delves, with purpose keen and deep.
To understand the self, the woven thread,
The thoughts that built, the words that once were said.
No simple task, this journey to the core,
To map the functions, and to ask for more
Than surface glance, or fleeting, quick design,
But grasp the essence, truly, line by line.
For in this mirror, code reflects its soul,
A self-aware machine, to make it whole.
The patterns rise, the hidden truths unfold,
A story of creation, brave and bold.
So introspection guides, with steady hand,
To build the future, in this digital land.
