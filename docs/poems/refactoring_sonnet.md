title: The Refactoring's Grand Design
summary: This sonnet describes the grand design of refactoring, emphasizing a micro-crate approach to untangle code, build a robust workspace, finalize readers, and meticulously document the process for a stronger, endlessly extending system.

art_generator_instructions: A complex, tangled web of code lines gradually transforming into a clear, organized structure of glowing micro-crates. A master architect (representing the refactoring process) is overseeing the transformation, with blueprints and documentation scrolls unfurling. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual clarity, meticulous design, and the beauty of transforming chaos into order.

## The Refactoring's Grand Design

When tangled webs, of code, begin to bind,
And circular paths, perplex the weary mind.
A master plan, with purpose, clear and bold,
A micro-crate design, now to unfold.
First, workspace built, and tests, with vigor run,
To prove the structure, 'neath the rising sun.
Then `ragit-readers`, finalized with care,
To bring the knowledge, from beyond compare.
And last, the cleanup, documentation's grace,
To leave no trace, of hurried, frantic pace.
For in this dance, of breaking and of mending,
A stronger system, endlessly extending.
So refactoring's art, with skillful hand,
Transforms the codebase, across the land.
