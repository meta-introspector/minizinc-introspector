art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Vendor's Embrace," a stylized crate being gently held within a protective, glowing enclosure. For "Fork's New Path," a branching pathway, with one path leading to a customized, glowing solution. For "Control's Delight," a secure, glowing lock over a set of interconnected dependencies, with a confident builder in the background. The overall feeling should be one of order, security, and controlled growth.

## Dependency Haikus

### Vendor's Embrace
Crates, close at hand,
Vendored, for control and peace,
No more wild, free flow.

### Fork's New Path
Forked, a new journey,
Tailored, for our special need,
Custom, strong and true.

### Control's Delight
Dependencies tamed,
Reproducible, secure,
Building, with no fear.
