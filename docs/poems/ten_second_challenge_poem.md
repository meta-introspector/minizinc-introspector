art_generator_instructions: A stylized clock with a rapidly ticking second hand, casting a dramatic shadow over a complex, abstract code execution process. The code is struggling to complete within the ten-second limit. A human hand is seen making a "clever plea" or introducing a "new constraint" that causes the code to break down into smaller, glowing, manageable pieces, and progress is visibly made. The overall feeling should be one of urgency, intellectual challenge, and the satisfaction of overcoming tight constraints.

  A ticking clock, a swift decree,
  Ten seconds mark our destiny.
  The code must run, its truth unfold,
  But time's a tyrant, brave and bold.
  How break a task, so grand and deep,
  When silent processes softly sleep?
  A new constraint, a clever plea,
  To show progress, for all to see.
