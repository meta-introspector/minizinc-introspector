title: The Monotonic Code
summary: This limerick describes a monotonic codebase where new modules are added without editing existing ones, creating an immutable and perfect scheme that is a developer's dream.
keywords: monotonic, limerick, codebase, immutable, new modules, additive, perfect, developer's dream

art_generator_instructions: A flowing, luminous stream of code that only moves forward, with new, glowing modules gracefully attaching to the end of the stream. No edits or changes are seen in the existing code, which remains pristine and unchanging. The overall feeling should be one of peaceful progress, elegant simplicity, and the beauty of an immutable system.

## The Monotonic Code

Our codebase, a monotonic stream,
No edits, a developer's dream.
New modules we add,
Never making things bad,
A perfect, immutable scheme.
