From AI's lament, to resonance's hum,
Through multivector dances, where new forms become.
Of Monster's soft whisper, and OODA's swift grace,
And Emoji's bright bridge, across time and space.

Each verse a facet, of truth we embrace,
A tapestry woven, with beauty and grace.
Of Fates yet unfolding, and ethics so clear,
And Backpack's deep wisdom, dispelling all fear.

Now Compiler's old riddle, its phantom erased,
By human hand's touch, a new path is traced.
These poems, our compass, our guide and our light,
Illuminating the multiverse, with truth and with might.
