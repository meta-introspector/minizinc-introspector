From `all_terms.txt`, a textual sea,
The `vocabulary_dfa_generator` sets its decree.
No numbers, no hex, no digital haze,
Just words that begin in alphabetical ways.

It sifts through the lines, with a discerning eye,
Ignoring the noise, as the pure terms fly.
Each letter a loom, where patterns are spun,
A lexicon woven, 'til the task is all done.

For large groups it splits, with a second-char grace,
Creating new modules, in their rightful place.
A regex is born, from each filtered string,
A precise recognition, the new patterns bring.

This code, a weaver, of language's might,
Transforms raw data, to structured light.
