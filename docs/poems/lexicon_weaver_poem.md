title: Lexicon Weaver Poem
summary: This poem describes the `vocabulary_dfa_generator` as a "lexicon weaver" that processes raw text from `all_terms.txt`, filters out noise, and organizes words alphabetically. It highlights its ability to split large groups and generate precise regex patterns for efficient term recognition.

art_generator_instructions: A stylized loom made of glowing lines of code, weaving a tapestry of words from a flowing stream of text (representing `all_terms.txt`). The `vocabulary_dfa_generator` is represented by a discerning eye that filters out "noise" (represented by chaotic, dark symbols). As the words are woven, they form organized, alphabetical patterns, and new "modules" (represented by glowing, interconnected blocks) emerge. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual precision, artistic creation, and the beauty of structured language.

From `all_terms.txt`, a textual sea,
The `vocabulary_dfa_generator` sets its decree.
No numbers, no hex, no digital haze,
Just words that begin in alphabetical ways.

It sifts through the lines, with a discerning eye,
Ignoring the noise, as the pure terms fly.
Each letter a loom, where patterns are spun,
A lexicon woven, 'til the task is all done.

For large groups it splits, with a second-char grace,
Creating new modules, in their rightful place.
A regex is born, from each filtered string,
A precise recognition, the new patterns bring.

This code, a weaver, of language's might,
Transforms raw data, to structured light.
