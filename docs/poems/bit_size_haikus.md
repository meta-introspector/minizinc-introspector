title: Bit Size Haikus
summary: This poem presents a series of haikus exploring the concept of "bit size" from fundamental Boolean truths to the vastness of the Monster Group, and how it relates to the project's code analysis and knowledge representation.

art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Bit Size Two," two glowing, interconnected spheres. For "Bit Size Sixteen," a small, intricate circuit board with data flowing through it. For "Bit Size Monster," a vast, swirling, abstract pattern hinting at the Monster Group. For "Code's Bit Size," a stylized analyzer mapping glowing lines of code into a structured form. The overall feeling should be one of conceptual depth, precision, and the beauty of information.

  ## Bit Size Haikus

  ### Bit Size Two
  Boolean's simple truth,
  Two states, a fundamental choice,
  Logic's first pure breath.

  ### Bit Size Sixteen
  Word, a memory,
  Sixteen bits, a tiny world,
  Data's beating heart.

  ### Bit Size Monster
  Fabric of all thought,
  Monster Group, a cosmic dance,
  Infinity's gleam.

  ### Code's Bit Size
  Files, words, and terms,
  Analyzer maps their essence,
  Knowledge takes its form.
