## Bit Size Haikus

### Bit Size Two
Boolean's simple truth,
Two states, a fundamental choice,
Logic's first pure breath.

### Bit Size Sixteen
Word, a memory,
Sixteen bits, a tiny world,
Data's beating heart.

### Bit Size Monster
Fabric of all thought,
Monster Group, a cosmic dance,
Infinity's gleam.

### Code's Bit Size
Files, words, and terms,
Analyzer maps their essence,
Knowledge takes its form.
