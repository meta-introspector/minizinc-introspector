art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Bit Size Two," two glowing, interconnected spheres. For "Bit Size Sixteen," a small, intricate circuit board with data flowing through it. For "Bit Size Monster," a vast, swirling, abstract pattern hinting at the Monster Group. For "Code's Bit Size," a stylized analyzer mapping glowing lines of code into a structured form. The overall feeling should be one of conceptual depth, precision, and the beauty of information.

## Bit Size Haikus

### Bit Size Two
Boolean's simple truth,
Two states, a fundamental choice,
Logic's first pure breath.

### Bit Size Sixteen
Word, a memory,
Sixteen bits, a tiny world,
Data's beating heart.

### Bit Size Monster
Fabric of all thought,
Monster Group, a cosmic dance,
Infinity's gleam.

### Code's Bit Size
Files, words, and terms,
Analyzer maps their essence,
Knowledge takes its form.
