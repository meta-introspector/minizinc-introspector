art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Critical Path," a clear, illuminated path emerging from a swirling "reboot" effect. For "Memory's Call," a stylized Gemini symbol with glowing lines connecting to a network of memories. For "Git's Embrace," a glowing `git log` output with recent commits highlighted, forming a complete narrative. The overall feeling should be one of clarity, purpose, and streamlined recovery.

  ## GM Meta-Program SOP Haikus

  ### Critical Path
  Reboot, clear the mind,
  Critical path, now in sight,
  Focus, sharp and true.

  ### Memory's Call
  Past thoughts, now recalled,
  Gemini's wisdom, deep and vast,
  Context, understood.

  ### Git's Embrace
  Commits, recent past,
  Changes woven, line by line,
  Journey, now complete.
