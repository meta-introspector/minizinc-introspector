art_generator_instructions: A glowing, intricate set of "guardrails" made of light, guiding a complex, abstract system (representing the project). Each guardrail is subtly labeled with icons for Six Sigma, ITIL, GMP, and ISO. A human hand is gently guiding a powerful, glowing LLM, ensuring it stays within the ethical boundaries. The overall feeling should be one of secure progress, responsible innovation, and the harmonious integration of technology and ethics.
