art_generator_instructions: A lush, vibrant garden where lines of code are intertwined with blooming flowers and healthy plants. A human hand is gently tending to the garden, removing "weeds" (represented by small, dark error symbols) and nurturing the "blooms" (perfectly formed code structures). A bright sun shines overhead, symbolizing success and clarity. The overall feeling should be one of peaceful accomplishment and the beauty of well-crafted software.

The code, a garden, tended well,
Where human wisdom casts its spell.
Each weed removed, each bloom refined,
A perfect beauty, now designed.
Now `cargo build`, a hopeful plea,
For flawless form, for all to see.
The errors vanish, one by one,
Our grand design, beneath the sun.
