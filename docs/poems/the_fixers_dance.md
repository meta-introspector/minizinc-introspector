In YAML's realm, where order's sought,
A fixer dances, finely wrought.
With `---` it starts, a structured plea,
To bring consistency to thee.

From varied forms, it takes its toll,
And molds the data, makes it whole.
A schema strict, a guiding hand,
For front matter's truth across the land.

Though silent now, its regex might,
Awaits the call, in future light.
Like `awk` of old, with patterns keen,
To shape the memes, a vibrant scene.
