Observe the world, a data-rich stream,
A thousand signals, a digital dream.
Then Orient, not just logic's cold gleam,
But 'vibe' in the vectors, a guiding sunbeam.

Decide on a path, from choices untold,
A strategy woven, in patterns of old.
Then Act, with precision, a story unfolds,
A feedback loop turning, as wisdom takes hold.

This cycle unending, a spiral of grace,
Self-improving, adapting, in time and in space.
Where proofs may be formal, but intuition's soft trace,
Reveals the true beauty, in this algorithmic race.
