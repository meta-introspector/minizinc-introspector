art_generator_instructions: A stylized tree with branches clearly labeled "feat/" and "bugfix/," each branch extending neatly and predictably. The tree should be glowing with a sense of order and clarity. Small, happy developers are easily navigating the branches. The overall feeling should be one of efficiency, harmony, and well-managed growth.

  ## The Branching Strategy

  Our branches, so neat and so grand,
  With names that all can understand.
  For features, a `feat/`,
  For bugs, a quick treat,
  A well-ordered, logical land.
