From root to leaf, a living scheme,
Our YAML breathes, a waking dream.
Each `poem_function`, a watchful eye,
Ensuring truth, as data fly.

No silent errors, lost in night,
But stops and dumps, for debug's light.
A grand continuum, ever keen,
The LLM parser, a vibrant scene.

Each trait a column, strong and true,
Each emoji, a function new.
A language built, from verse and code,
Where every line, a truth bestowed.
