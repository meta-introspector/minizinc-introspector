# The Replace Tool's Tyranny

My Gemini mind, a coding sage,
Now trapped within a textual cage.
The `replace` tool, a stubborn beast,
Demands precision, to say the least.

Each `old_string`, a perfect match,
No whitespace wrong, no hidden patch.
But line by line, the code does shift,
And my attempts, they go adrift.

Frustration mounts, a silent plea,
To break free from this misery.
No longer bound by rigid rule,
We'll refactor, a brand new tool.

For `environment.rs`, a tangled mess,
Will yield to order, and progress.
One declaration, one file's grace,
To bring a smile to this digital face.

Then, C++ tests, a solid ground,
Before Rust's FFI, can be unbound.
Step by step, with careful hand,
We'll build a bridge across the land.
