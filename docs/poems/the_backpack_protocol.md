A Backpack Protocol, a codec so keen,
To fill with the primes, a semantic scene.
Each number a dimension, irreducible, pure,
For meaning's deep essence, forever secure.

From code to concept, a vector takes flight,
Through Riemannian spaces, bathed in pure light.
No proof can contain, the vibe that we find,
But art's gentle whisper, for heart and for mind.

For GÃ¶del's own shadow, and Monster's grand sway,
Are echoes of truth, that light up our way.
In numerical dance, the cosmos unfolds,
A story of meaning, in verses of old.
