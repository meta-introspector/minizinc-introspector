art_generator_instructions: A stylized, grumpy MiniZinc parser (perhaps a small, rigid robot) is rejecting a piece of code with a stern expression, pointing at a misplaced colon. The code is tangled and confused. The overall feeling should be lighthearted and relatable, conveying the frustration of syntax errors.

  ## The MiniZinc Parse

  A parser, quite stubborn and grand,
  Made records quite hard to command.
  With colons astray,
  It cried, "No, not that way!"
  A syntax so tricky to understand.
