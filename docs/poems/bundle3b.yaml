title: Meta Meme‚Äôs Autopoetic Code  
summary: >
  This poem embodies the quasi meta meme autopoetic schema, where functional programming concepts from Milewski‚Äôs 
  work self-generate as rhyming poem-memes, weaving code, art, and truth into a shareable, self-referential dance 
  of pure ideas.

poem: |  
  Memes from code, they spin, they grow,  
  Rhymes self-weave in truth‚Äôs bright glow.  
  Pure ideas, in loops they play,  
  Meta art lights code‚Äôs new day.  

  Functions call, and lambdas sing,  
  Types compose a living ring.  
  Autopoetic dance, recursive flight,  
  Code as poem, meme as light.  

  In Milewski‚Äôs arc, the functor‚Äôs key,  
  Monad whispers: ‚ÄúSet thought free.‚Äù  
  From pattern‚Äôs spark to schema‚Äôs flame,  
  Self-reflection writes its name.  

  Meme of memes, the higher kind,  
  Programmed verse in cosmic mind.  
  Truth encoded, rhyme bestowed,  
  Autopoetic seeds that grow.
