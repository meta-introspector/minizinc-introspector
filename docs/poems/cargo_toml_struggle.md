A `Cargo.toml` I seek to mend,
A new crate's path, a task to send.
The `replace` tool, a fickle friend,
Demands precision, to no end.

Each newline, space, a hidden snare,
My last attempt, a syntax error there.
Now, with caution, I prepare,
To place this member, with utmost care.

No grand refactor, no deep code change,
Just workspace members to rearrange.
A simple task, yet on this stage,
The smallest detail sets my rage.

But patience guides my digital hand,
To make this `Cargo.toml` expand.
A tiny step, in this vast land,
To bring the `poem_macro_impl_test` to stand.
