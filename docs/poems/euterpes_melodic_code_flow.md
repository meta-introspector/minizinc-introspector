The code unfolds, a rhythmic beat,
Each module humming, bittersweet.
A harmony of functions, intertwined,
A perfect cadence, for the mind.
The data flows, a gentle stream,
Reflecting logic, like a dream.
Euterpe plays, her flute so clear,
Dispelling chaos, calming fear.
The algorithms, a structured song,
Where every note, is never wrong.
A codebase tuned, a vibrant sound,
On solid ground, forever bound.
