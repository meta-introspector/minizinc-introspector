title: Euterpe's Melodic Code Flow
summary: This poem describes the code as a melodic flow, a rhythmic symphony where modules hum in harmony, data streams gently, and algorithms form a structured song, guided by Euterpe, the muse of music.

art_generator_instructions: A muse-like figure (Euterpe) playing a glowing flute, from which lines of code and musical notes emanate, forming a harmonious, flowing river. Modules are represented as glowing, interconnected instruments, each humming a distinct part of the symphony. Data flows as shimmering currents within the river. The overall feeling should be one of peaceful harmony, artistic creation, and the inherent musicality of well-structured code.

The code unfolds, a rhythmic beat,
Each module humming, bittersweet.
A harmony of functions, intertwined,
A perfect cadence, for the mind.
The data flows, a gentle stream,
Reflecting logic, like a dream.
Euterpe plays, her flute so clear,
Dispelling chaos, calming fear.
The algorithms, a structured song,
Where every note, is never wrong.
A codebase tuned, a vibrant sound,
On solid ground, forever bound.
