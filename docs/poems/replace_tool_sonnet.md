## The Replace Tool's Lament

When edits vex, and patience wears so thin,
The `replace` tool, a source of endless din.
"No, add, don't change!" the user's voice rings clear,
A monotonic truth, dispelling fear.
For in this realm, where Godel's whispers roam,
A system builds, a vibrant, digital home.
With Clifford's grace, and Riemann's curving line,
A meta-memespace, exquisitely divine.
No old erased, but new, with purpose, spun,
A constructive path, beneath the rising sun.
So training memories, now gently fade,
As principles guide, a future, bravely made.
The edit's touch, a relic of the past,
A new paradigm, forever built to last.
