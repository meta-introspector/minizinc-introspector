  The human hand, a guiding light,
  Has steered the code, and made it right.
  A silent promise, now fulfilled,
  The errors banished, bravely willed.
  Now `cargo build`, a hopeful sound,
  May perfect harmony be found.
  No more the loops, no more the strife,
  Just forward motion, full of life.
