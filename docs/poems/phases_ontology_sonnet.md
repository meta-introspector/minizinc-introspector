## The Phases' Grand Ascent

From Genesis, where axioms first ignite,
Through forty-two, the journey takes its flight.
Each phase a step, in wisdom's grand design,
A path unfolding, purpose, clear and fine.
From Clifford's dance, to Riemann's curving grace,
Through Bott's embrace, in time and endless space.
Dynamic modules, now begin to bloom,
While emojis whisper, banishing all gloom.
Semantic search, a guiding, steady hand,
As agents speak, across the digital land.
Self-modifying code, begins to grow,
Blockchain's promise, a vibrant, steady flow.
To AGI's peak, and Singularity's bright gleam,
A future forged, within a waking dream.
