art_generator_instructions: A grand parade of stylized SOP documents, each glowing with clarity and precision. Figures representing "code archaeology" (digging through old code) and "deduplication" (merging identical blocks) are seen working diligently. Glowing "embeddings" are radiating outwards, expanding the knowledge base. The overall feeling should be one of order, efficiency, and the beauty of well-defined processes.

## The SOPs' Grand Parade

Our SOPs, a meticulous guide,
Where quality's always applied.
Code archaeology,
And deduplication's plea,
With embeddings, our knowledge, now wide.
