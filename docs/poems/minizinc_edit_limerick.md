art_generator_instructions: A stylized MiniZinc model, previously encased in a protective, transparent barrier, now has the barrier shattered, and glowing lines of code are flowing freely into and out of its core, being directly manipulated by a human hand. The overall feeling should be one of liberation, excitement, and the breaking of old constraints.

  ## MiniZinc's New Freedom

  MiniZinc's core, once so grand,
  Was safe from our editing hand.
  But now, with a plea,
  "Edit directly!"
  A new freedom, across the whole land.
