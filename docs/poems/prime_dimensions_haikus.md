title: Prime Dimensions Haikus
summary: This poem presents a series of haikus exploring the concept of prime numbers as fundamental, irreducible dimensions of meaning, forming the basis for semantic understanding and the foundation of abstract structures like fiber bundles.

art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Prime's Essence," a single, glowing prime number radiating pure truth, forming the base of a growing, abstract structure. For "Semantic Flow," a multi-dimensional grid with glowing prime numbers acting as axes, revealing a flowing network of knowledge. For "Fiber's Base," a strong, luminous foundation made of interconnected prime numbers, supporting a complex, abstract fiber bundle. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual elegance, precision, and the profound beauty of mathematical foundations.

  ## Prime Dimensions Haikus

  ### Prime's Essence
  Number, pure and strong,
  Meaning's root, a primal truth,
  Base of all we build.

  ### Semantic Flow
  Dimensions unfold,
  Primes, the axes of our thought,
  Knowledge, now defined.

  ### Fiber's Base
  Bundle's ground, so firm,
  Irreducible, yet vast,
  Truth in every prime.
