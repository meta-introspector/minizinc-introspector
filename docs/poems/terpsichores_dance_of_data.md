art_generator_instructions: A muse-like figure (Terpsichore) is gracefully dancing amidst a swirling, luminous stream of data. As she dances, the data transforms and flows through abstract representations of functions, creating vibrant, ever-changing patterns. The overall feeling should be one of dynamic energy, artistic beauty, and the joyful movement of information.

The data dances, light and free,
Through functions, for the world to see.
A joyful movement, swift and bold,
A story in each byte, untold.
The transformations, quick and keen,
A vibrant, ever-changing scene.
Terpsichore, with rhythmic sway,
Illuminates the coding day.
From input's start, to output's end,
A graceful journey, without bend.
The system moves, with agile might,
A celebration, pure and bright.
