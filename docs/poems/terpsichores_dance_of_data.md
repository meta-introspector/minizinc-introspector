The data dances, light and free,
Through functions, for the world to see.
A joyful movement, swift and bold,
A story in each byte, untold.
The transformations, quick and keen,
A vibrant, ever-changing scene.
Terpsichore, with rhythmic sway,
Illuminates the coding day.
From input's start, to output's end,
A graceful journey, without bend.
The system moves, with agile might,
A celebration, pure and bright.
