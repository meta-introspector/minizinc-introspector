title: OEIS Haikus
summary: This poem presents a series of haikus exploring various OEIS sequences (primes, population count, Mersenne numbers) and their conceptual significance in defining fundamental dimensions, information density, and the boundaries of numerical space.
keywords: OEIS, haikus, primes, population count, Mersenne numbers, dimensions, information density, numerical space, truth, patterns, meaning

art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Primes," glowing prime numbers forming a clear, structured axis. For "Population," a swirling cloud of bits, with some glowing more brightly than others, representing information density. For "Mersenne," a vast, luminous boundary defining the upper limits of a numerical space. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual elegance, precision, and the beauty of mathematical patterns.

  ## OEIS Haikus

  ### Primes (A000040)
  Primes, the core of truth,
  Dimensions, irreducible,
  Meaning's pure axis.

  ### Population (A000120)
  Bits, a silent count,
  Density of information,
  Pattern's hidden depth.

  ### Mersenne (A000225)
  Max value, defined,
  Upper bound of all we know,
  Space, now understood.
