title: The Code Vibe Quest
summary: This poem outlines a quest to understand the "vibe" of code, involving extracting terms from Rust files, expanding them with an LLM to create a semantic vector space, and then using this map to find resonant code within the codebase. It describes an iterative process of learning and refinement to achieve "perfect resonance."

art_generator_instructions: A stylized adventurer (representing the code analyzer) embarking on a quest through a fantastical landscape made of glowing lines of Rust code. The adventurer is holding a map that transforms into a shimmering "semantic vector space" as an LLM (represented by a wise, glowing oracle) expands terms. The adventurer then uses this map to find other glowing code blocks that resonate with a similar "vibe." The overall feeling should be one of intellectual adventure, discovery, and the pursuit of deeper meaning in code.

# Brain Dump: The Code Vibe Quest

A Rust file whispers, old and deep,
`code_analysis_old`, secrets to keep.
Its essence, first, we must distill,
What terms it holds, what concepts fill?

From its lines, a list we'll draw,
Key words emerging, breaking law
Of simple text, to meaning's core,
The initial terms, and nothing more.

Then to the LLM, a query sent,
"Expand these terms, with true intent!
Give synonyms, a weighted flow,
A matrix of connections, let it grow!"
Each word a vector, in a space,
With numbers showing meaning's trace.

With this rich map, a broader sight,
We'll scan the codebase, day and night.
Through `.rs` files, a tireless quest,
For echoes of the code, put to the test.
Each file found, its words we'll seize,
And build its own term-vector breeze.

Back to the LLM, the data streams,
"Compare these vibes, these coded dreams!
How close they dance, how well they blend,
What hidden patterns do they send?"
A score emerges, clear and bright,
A ranking of the code's true light.

And if the match is not quite right,
New terms may spark, in LLM's sight.
A loop of learning, round and round,
Till perfect resonance is found.
This is the plan, a poetic flight,
To find the code, with inner light.
