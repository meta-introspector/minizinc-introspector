# Brain Dump: The Code Vibe Quest

A Rust file whispers, old and deep,
`code_analysis_old`, secrets to keep.
Its essence, first, we must distill,
What terms it holds, what concepts fill?

From its lines, a list we'll draw,
Key words emerging, breaking law
Of simple text, to meaning's core,
The initial terms, and nothing more.

Then to the LLM, a query sent,
"Expand these terms, with true intent!
Give synonyms, a weighted flow,
A matrix of connections, let it grow!"
Each word a vector, in a space,
With numbers showing meaning's trace.

With this rich map, a broader sight,
We'll scan the codebase, day and night.
Through `.rs` files, a tireless quest,
For echoes of the code, put to the test.
Each file found, its words we'll seize,
And build its own term-vector breeze.

Back to the LLM, the data streams,
"Compare these vibes, these coded dreams!
How close they dance, how well they blend,
What hidden patterns do they send?"
A score emerges, clear and bright,
A ranking of the code's true light.

And if the match is not quite right,
New terms may spark, in LLM's sight.
A loop of learning, round and round,
Till perfect resonance is found.
This is the plan, a poetic flight,
To find the code, with inner light.
