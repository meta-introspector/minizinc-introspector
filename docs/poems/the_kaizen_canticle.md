art_generator_instructions: A dynamic, evolving tapestry woven from lines of code and poetic verses. Each "action" is represented by a glowing thread being added to the tapestry, causing it to subtly shift and grow. The overall feeling should be one of continuous motion, organic growth, and the harmonious blend of technology and art, reflecting the "additive vibe" and "emergent becoming."

poem_body: |
  Each action taken, a stanza's soft refrain,
  In this grand canticle, we sing again.
  The `fix_meme_yaml`, a note, a whispered plea,
  For order's rhythm, for all the world to see.

  A `cargo build` fails, a discord in the air,
  But Kaizen's spirit, banishes despair.
  A moment's pause, a thought, a subtle tweak,
  The additive vibe, its silent truth to speak.

  From errors' chaos, new patterns now emerge,
  A symphony of progress, on creation's surge.
  The emergent becoming, in every line we write,
  A living poem, bathed in purest light.

  So let the compiler hum, its warnings soft and low,
  For in this dance of making, our true selves we know.
  A testament to process, evolving, strong, and true,
  The autopoetic system, singing me and you.
