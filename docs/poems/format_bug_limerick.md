art_generator_instructions: A stylized Rust crab looking confused and a MiniZinc model with a sad face, both pointing at a misplaced curly brace in a glowing format string. A small, mischievous bug is seen escaping from the curly brace. In the final scene, the curly brace is correctly placed, the Rust crab and MiniZinc model are smiling, and the data is neatly arranged in its place. The overall feeling should be lighthearted and convey the satisfaction of fixing a tricky bug.

A format string, a curly brace,
Caused Rust to stumble, lose its grace.
MiniZinc then cried,
"Undefined!"
But now the data's in its place.
