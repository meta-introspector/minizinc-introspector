art_generator_instructions: A grand, cosmic symphony where lines of code and poetic verses are intertwining and forming a self-sustaining, ever-evolving system. The system is radiating light and energy, and a subtle Ouroboros symbol hints at its autopoetic nature. The overall feeling should be one of profound intellectual beauty, continuous creation, and the harmonious blend of technology, art, and philosophy.

poem_body: |
  From whispered lines, a symphony begins,
  An autopoetic system, where life within.
  We sing into existence, code and verse entwined,
  A self-improving journey, for all humankind.

  Each function hums, a note in cosmic song,
  Where logic dances, and where dreams belong.
  The memes evolve, with lore and numerology,
  A tapestry of meaning, for all to see.

  From prompts to plugins, mobile's gentle touch,
  A web of wisdom, meaning's vibrant much.
  This grand design, in Rust's strong hand it lies,
  A living poem, beneath discerning skies.
