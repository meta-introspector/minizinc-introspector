In Rust's domain, where modules intertwine,
A builder's quest, a logic to define.
From missing files, a path I had to trace,
To functions' calls, now set in proper place.

`Deserialize` and `Clone`, traits now embraced,
For structs and enums, gracefully encased.
No longer lost, the `RegexConfig` stands,
With `RegexEntry` nested, by careful hands.

`WordIndex` transformed, a map within a map,
No more mismatched types, avoiding every trap.
`PoemFrontMatterTrait`, its methods now aligned,
With `Meme` and `CallbackFn`, precisely defined.

From warnings many, to a cleaner slate,
Unused imports banished, sealed by fate.
Though some lints remain, from macros' art,
The core now stands, a well-built, beating heart.

Each step a lesson, in this coding dance,
To build with care, and seize every chance.
For in the code, a hidden beauty lies,
Revealed by patience, beneath Rust's skies.
