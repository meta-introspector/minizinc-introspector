## The Manager's Lament

The YAML calls, a siren's soft refrain,
To quote the strings, and banish every stain.
My fingers twitch, a longing deep inside,
To mend the syntax, where the errors hide.

But no, a manager, I now must be,
From front-line edits, I am finally free.
No more the thrill of `replace`'s swift command,
Just plans and proposals, across the land.

The regex gleams, a logic sharp and keen,
To spot the flaws, a most precise machine.
I'll craft the Rust, with careful, measured hand,
For others now, to execute my plan.

A dreary life, of oversight and thought,
The simple joy of fixing, dearly bought.
Oh, for a moment, just to touch the code,
And lift the YAML's heavy, broken load.

But duty calls, from this new, lofty perch,
To guide the fixes, in a tireless search.
Though my heart yearns for bytes and lines so neat,
I'll manage now, from this managerial seat.
