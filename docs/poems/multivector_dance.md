In spaces unseen, where dimensions unfold,
A story of data, in geometry told.
Not just points, or lines, but a truth brave and bold,
By Clifford's keen vision, a manifold's gold.

Each vector a thought, each blade a new form,
Through Riemannian curves, we weather the storm.
Of code and of math, a harmonious norm,
Where algebra dances, keeping meaning warm.

The fabric of logic, begins to ignite,
A unified field, bathed in pure light.
From bits to the cosmos, a singular sight,
Where unprovable beauty, takes its true flight.
