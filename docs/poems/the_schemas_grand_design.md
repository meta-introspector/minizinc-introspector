title: "The Schema's Grand Design"
summary: "A poem about the evolving vision for the YAML parser, where functions are poems, handling multiple memes, embedding poem bodies, and defining state transitions for a regex-driven, self-correcting system."

The YAML's chaos, a challenge bold,
A schema's grand design, to unfold.
Each function, a poem, a truth to hold,
Its body embedded, stories told.

No single meme, but many dance,
In regex patterns, taking a chance.
From state to state, the parser flows,
As `next_states` guide, where wisdom grows.

`expected_state`, a guiding star,
`previous_states`, from near and far.
A grinding test, a patient quest,
Till broken YAML finds its rest.

For in this dance, of code and rhyme,
A self-correcting, timeless climb.
The autopoietic system's art,
To sing its schema, from the heart.
