art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Input's Call," a stream of raw, glowing data flowing into a central point. For "Process's Dance," the data is actively transforming and shaping within a complex, glowing network of logic. For "Output's Truth," a clear, luminous result emerging from the process, radiating new knowledge. The overall feeling should be one of elegant transformation, purposeful flow, and the beauty of a well-defined system.

  ## IPO Haikus

  ### Input's Call
  Data flows within,
  Raw and pure, awaiting form,
  Seed of what will be.

  ### Process's Dance
  Logic now unfolds,
  Transforming, shaping, creating,
  Meaning, now defined.

  ### Output's Truth
  Result, clear and bright,
  New knowledge, now revealed,
  Purpose, now complete.
