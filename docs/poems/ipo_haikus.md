art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Input's Call," a stream of raw, glowing data flowing into a central point. For "Process's Dance," the data is actively transforming and shaping within a complex, glowing network of logic. For "Output's Truth," a clear, luminous result emerging from the process, radiating new knowledge. The overall feeling should be one of elegant transformation, purposeful flow, and the beauty of a well-defined system.

## IPO Haikus

### Input's Call
Data flows within,
Raw and pure, awaiting form,
Seed of what will be.

### Process's Dance
Logic now unfolds,
Transforming, shaping, creating,
Meaning, now defined.

### Output's Truth
Result, clear and bright,
New knowledge, now revealed,
Purpose, now complete.
