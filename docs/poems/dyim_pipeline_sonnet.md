## The DYIM Pipeline's Strain

To build a space, where meaning takes its flight,
The DYIM pipeline, strives with all its might.
From file's raw form, to vectors, pure and keen,
A semantic journey, rarely seen.
But `sophia_rs`, a tangled, thorny vine,
With API's clash, and versions out of line.
Manual patches, a weary, endless task,
Beneath the code, a hidden, fragile mask.
Yet still we push, with purpose, strong and true,
To mend the breaks, and see the vision through.
For in this struggle, beauty will arise,
A vectorspace, beneath discerning skies.
So onward still, though challenges abound,
Where semantic resonance can be found.
