art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Crate's Root," a glowing, stylized crate with a single, strong root extending downwards. For "Source's Path," a clean, illuminated path leading through neatly organized lines of code. For "Cargo's Heart," a stylized `Cargo.toml` file with glowing lines connecting to various "dependencies" (represented by smaller, interconnected boxes), all pulsating with a steady rhythm. The overall feeling should be one of order, clarity, and the foundational elements of a software project.

## Crate Ontologies Haikus

### Crate's Root
Root, a symbol clear,
Crate's heart, where all begins,
Code's first, gentle breath.

### Source's Path
Src, a folder's gleam,
Code resides, in ordered lines,
Logic's pure design.

### Cargo's Heart
Cargo, a manifest,
Dependencies, neatly bound,
Build's true, steady pulse.
