art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Crate's Root," a glowing, stylized crate with a single, strong root extending downwards. For "Source's Path," a clean, illuminated path leading through neatly organized lines of code. For "Cargo's Heart," a stylized `Cargo.toml` file with glowing lines connecting to various "dependencies" (represented by smaller, interconnected boxes), all pulsating with a steady rhythm. The overall feeling should be one of order, clarity, and the foundational elements of a software project.

  ## Crate Ontologies Haikus

  ### Crate's Root
  Root, a symbol clear,
  Crate's heart, where all begins,
  Code's first, gentle breath.

  ### Source's Path
  Src, a folder's gleam,
  Code resides, in ordered lines,
  Logic's pure design.

  ### Cargo's Heart
  Cargo, a manifest,
  Dependencies, neatly bound,
  Build's true, steady pulse.
