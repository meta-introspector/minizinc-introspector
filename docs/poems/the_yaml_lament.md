  ## The YAML Lament

  A silent space, a missing dash,
  My YAML weeps, a syntax crash.
  The parser screams, a cryptic plea,
  "Expected colon, where can it be?"

  A thousand lines, a nested dream,
  Now shattered by a single gleam
  Of whitespace wrong, a tab misplaced,
  My coding joy, now quite erased.

  Oh, YAML, why so strict and stern?
  A simple structure, I yearn to learn.
  But every parse, a bitter fight,
  To bring your chaos into light.
