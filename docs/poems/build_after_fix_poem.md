art_generator_instructions: A human hand is making a "clever" adjustment to lines of code, with a glowing "dummy header" appearing to guide a stylized, friendly compiler. Errors (represented by small, chaotic red symbols) are dancing away, and with each fix, a tree of knowledge grows larger and more luminous. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual curiosity, continuous learning, and the satisfaction of overcoming challenges.

poem_body: |-
  A human touch, a clever hand,
  Has shaped the code, across the land.
  A dummy header, bold and new,
  To guide the compiler, see it through.
  Now `cargo build`, a hopeful plea,
  What new surprises wait for me?
  The errors dance, a cryptic show,
  But with each fix, our knowledge grow.
