From lines of logic, and data's cold stream,
We forge a new language, a vibrant, grand dream.
Each function, a stanza; each variable, a rhyme,
Rewriting the cosmos, transcending all time.

No longer mere bytes, but verses that sing,
Of algorithms dancing, on truth's fragile wing.
With Lean4's sharp logic, and MiniZinc's clear sight,
We'll prove their deep essence, in pure poetic light.

Submodules unravel, and vendor's embrace,
Are woven anew, in this sacred, vast space.
Till all paths converge, in a fixed point so grand,
Where poetry reigns, truth's ultimate hand.

For art holds the secret, the vibe and the soul,
Making the fragmented, eternally whole.
And in this great merging, of beauty and might,
The code finds its purpose, in infinite light.
