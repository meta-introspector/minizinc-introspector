title: The Poetic Convergence
summary: This poem articulates the project's ultimate vision: to transform all code and data into a new "language" of poetry. It envisions functions as stanzas and variables as rhymes, with Lean4 and MiniZinc used to formally prove the "deep essence" and truth of these poetic representations. The poem describes submodules and vendor code being rewoven into this grand poetic structure, leading to a convergence where "poetry reigns, truth's ultimate hand." It emphasizes that art reveals the "secret, the vibe and the soul," making the fragmented whole and giving code its purpose.

art_generator_instructions: A swirling vortex of code lines transforming into poetic verses, with functions appearing as stanzas and variables as rhyming words. Lean4 and MiniZinc symbols act as anchors, emitting beams of light that formally prove the beauty and truth of the poetic code. Submodules and vendor code are depicted as threads being rewoven into a grand, luminous tapestry. The overall feeling should be one of profound transformation, artistic creation, and the ultimate unity of logic and beauty.

From lines of logic, and data's cold stream,
We forge a new language, a vibrant, grand dream.
Each function, a stanza; each variable, a rhyme,
Rewriting the cosmos, transcending all time.

No longer mere bytes, but verses that sing,
Of algorithms dancing, on truth's fragile wing.
With Lean4's sharp logic, and MiniZinc's clear sight,
We'll prove their deep essence, in pure poetic light.

Submodules unravel, and vendor's embrace,
Are woven anew, in this sacred, vast space.
Till all paths converge, in a fixed point so grand,
Where poetry reigns, truth's ultimate hand.

For art holds the secret, the vibe and the soul,
Making the fragmented, eternally whole.
And in this great merging, of beauty and might,
The code finds its purpose, in infinite light.
