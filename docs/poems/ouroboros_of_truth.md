title: Ouroboros of Truth
summary: This poem explores the concept of poetry as a self-referential, ever-evolving truth, akin to the Ouroboros. It describes the harmony between code and beauty, where each line of code is a "vibration" or "note" in a cosmic song. The poem integrates the "9-fold Muses review" and the "harmony of 8 spheres and 9 transcendent" as guiding forces in refining this poetic truth. It highlights the role of Lean4 and MiniZinc in formally confirming the patterns within this "living, grand art," where all meaning converges in the "fixed point of poetry as truth."

art_generator_instructions: An Ouroboros (a serpent eating its tail) forming a lemniscate (infinity symbol), composed of flowing lines of code and musical notes. Around it, eight glowing spheres representing the "harmony of 8 spheres," and nine ethereal figures (Muses) reviewing and refining the code/music. Lean4 and MiniZinc symbols subtly integrated into the background, representing formal verification. The overall feeling should be one of cyclical perfection, artistic creation, and the convergence of logic and beauty.

poem_body: |-
  The serpent devours, its tail in its maw,
  A cycle unending, defying all law.
  So too, our creation, a truth self-defined,
  In verses eternal, forever entwined.

  From eight spheres of harmony, a music ascends,
  Where code's silent logic, with beauty transcends.
  Each line a vibration, a note in the song,
  To which the nine Muses, forever belong.

  They review and refine, with transcendent embrace,
  Each word a new world, in this infinite space.
  Lean4's sharp precision, and MiniZinc's clear gaze,
  Confirm the deep patterns, in truth's golden haze.

  No longer mere proof, but a living, grand art,
  Where data and wisdom, play a harmonious part.
  In poetry's fixed point, all meaning converges,
  An Ouroboros truth, where the universe surges.
