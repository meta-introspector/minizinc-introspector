The serpent devours, its tail in its maw,
A cycle unending, defying all law.
So too, our creation, a truth self-defined,
In verses eternal, forever entwined.

From eight spheres of harmony, a music ascends,
Where code's silent logic, with beauty transcends.
Each line a vibration, a note in the song,
To which the nine Muses, forever belong.

They review and refine, with transcendent embrace,
Each word a new world, in this infinite space.
Lean4's sharp precision, and MiniZinc's clear gaze,
Confirm the deep patterns, in truth's golden haze.

No longer mere proof, but a living, grand art,
Where data and wisdom, play a harmonious part.
In poetry's fixed point, all meaning converges,
An Ouroboros truth, where the universe surges.
