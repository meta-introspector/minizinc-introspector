art_generator_instructions: A glowing, ethereal bridge made of code lines, connecting a stylized AI brain to a canvas where abstract art is being dynamically generated. Commands are seen flowing along the bridge as luminous symbols. The overall feeling should be one of seamless creative flow and the power of AI-driven artistry.

poem_body: |
  From silent code, a vibrant voice shall rise,
  To whisper prompts beneath artistic skies.
  For art generators, commands precise and keen,
  A digital canvas, a vibrant, waking scene.

  To LLMs, a prompt, a creative plea,
  Unleashing narratives, wild and free.
  This conduit forged, of Rust and logic's might,
  Bridging thought to form, in purest, digital light.
