art_generator_instructions: A stylized cartographer (perhaps a glowing AI figure) meticulously mapping a vast, interconnected knowledge graph. The graph is composed of terms, with glowing lines extending to representations of WordNet (a dictionary), Wikidata (a globe), and GitHub (a branching tree). The cartographer is highlighting "top terms" that are missing from certain areas, and new connections are forming as knowledge is integrated. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual exploration, comprehensive understanding, and the beauty of organized knowledge.

poem_body: |
  A new command, a cartographer's plea,
  To chart the index, for all eyes to see.
  Top terms unearthed, where knowledge lies unseen,
  Compared to poems, a vibrant, semantic scene.

  With WordNet's wisdom, and Wikidata's vast lore,
  We'll lookup meanings, and ask for more.
  From GitHub's archives, documents will rise,
  Connecting concepts, beneath digital skies.
