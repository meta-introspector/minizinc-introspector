art_generator_instructions: A stylized, glowing tree (representing version control) with branches extending outwards, each branch representing a different version or commit. Hands (representing collaborators) are seen contributing to the tree, and conflicts are resolved as tangled branches gracefully untangle and merge. The overall feeling should be one of order, collaboration, and the continuous growth of a robust system.

## The Version's Steady Hand

When changes flow, a river, swift and deep,
And countless hands, their contributions lend.
A silent guardian, secrets it will keep,
The version's hand, on which we all depend.
Each commit marked, a moment held in time,
A snapshot taken, of the evolving art.
No lost endeavor, no forgotten rhyme,
But history preserved, from every part.
For collaboration's dance, it sets the stage,
Where conflicts merge, and harmony takes hold.
A reliable past, on every page,
A story of progress, bravely to be told.
So praise the system, steadfast, strong, and true,
That builds the future, from the old and new.
