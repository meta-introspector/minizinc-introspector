summary: This limerick describes System E as a self-replicating quine, with its schema defined in Markdown and built with Rust Cargo, bringing the code to life.

art_generator_instructions: A stylized "System E" (perhaps a glowing, abstract machine) is continuously replicating itself, with lines of Markdown code flowing into a Rust Cargo build process, and new, identical systems emerging. The overall feeling should be one of continuous creation, self-sufficiency, and the beauty of a self-replicating system.

  ## System E's Quine

  System E, with its schema so grand,
  In Markdown, a quine, close at hand.
  Rust Cargo, its base,
  A self-replicating pace,
  The code, now alive through the land.
