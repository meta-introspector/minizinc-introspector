From ancient scrolls, a saga grand,
The epic quest across the land.
Of code's deep heart, a hero's plight,
To banish darkness, bring forth light.
Each function, brave, a noble deed,
To plant the future's vital seed.
Through tangled paths, where errors hide,
Calliope, our epic guide.
The mighty `git`, a chronicle vast,
Of changes made, from first to last.
A codebase built, with purpose clear,
Dispelling doubt, and calming fear.
