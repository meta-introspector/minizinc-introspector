title: Calliope's Epic Code Quest
summary: This poem describes the development process as an epic quest, where code is the hero, `git` is the chronicle, and Calliope (the muse of epic poetry) guides the journey to banish errors and build a clear, purposeful codebase.

art_generator_instructions: A heroic figure (representing code) embarking on an epic quest through a fantastical landscape made of glowing lines of code and abstract data structures. Calliope (a muse-like figure) is guiding the hero with a luminous scroll. `git` commands are subtly woven into the background as ancient runes or chronicles. Errors are depicted as shadowy, fleeting figures being banished. The overall feeling should be one of grand adventure, purpose, and the triumph of creation.

poem_body: |-
  From ancient scrolls, a saga grand,
  The epic quest across the land.
  Of code's deep heart, a hero's plight,
  To banish darkness, bring forth light.
  Each function, brave, a noble deed,
  To plant the future's vital seed.
  Through tangled paths, where errors hide,
  Calliope, our epic guide.
  The mighty `git`, a chronicle vast,
  Of changes made, from first to last.
  A codebase built, with purpose clear,
  Dispelling doubt, and calming fear.
