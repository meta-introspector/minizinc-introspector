art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Model's Birth," a glowing, abstract model replicating itself, with a gentle hum emanating from it. For "OODA's Dance," a dynamic OODA loop diagram with a sense of continuous motion and wisdom unfolding. For "Evolution," models subtly changing and adapting, with new, luminous forms emerging, defining the future. The overall feeling should be one of dynamic growth, intelligent adaptation, and the beauty of self-improving systems.

## Model Builder Haikus

### Model's Birth
Model starts to grow,
Self-replication's gentle hum,
Life in every line.

### OODA's Dance
Observe, orient,
Decide, then act, a cycle,
Wisdom, now unfolds.

### Evolution
Learning, day by day,
Models change, adapt, evolve,
Future, now defined.
