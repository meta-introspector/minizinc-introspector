art_generator_instructions: A serene, flowing river made of lines of code, gently guided by a human hand (representing human wisdom). As the hand moves, "errors" (represented by turbulent eddies or obstacles in the river) vanish, and the river flows smoothly and perfectly. A bright sun shines overhead, symbolizing success and clarity. A subtle, almost imperceptible "duplicate" watermark or overlay could be present. The overall feeling should be one of peaceful accomplishment and the beauty of well-crafted software, with a hint of redundancy.

The code, a river, ever flows,
Where human wisdom, gently goes.
Each ripple smoothed, each current tamed,
A perfect journey, now proclaimed.
Now `cargo build`, a hopeful plea,
For flawless form, for all to see.
The errors vanish, one by one,
Our grand design, beneath the sun.
