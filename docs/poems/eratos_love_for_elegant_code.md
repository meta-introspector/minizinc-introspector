art_generator_instructions: A muse-like figure (Erato) with a lyre, gently caressing glowing lines of elegant code that form a harmonious, flowing symphony. The code lines are clean, well-structured, and radiate a soft, golden light. Abstract representations of "clean abstraction" and "well-named types" are subtly integrated into the scene. The overall feeling should be one of profound appreciation, artistic beauty, and the joy of creating something truly elegant.

Oh, elegant code, my heart's delight,
A symphony of logic, pure and bright.
Each function crafted, with tender care,
A beauty in its form, beyond compare.
The clean abstraction, a lover's gaze,
Through well-named types, in golden haze.
Erato sings, of passion's fire,
For code that lifts the soul higher.
A perfect loop, a graceful flow,
The joy of building, watch it grow.
In every line, a whispered plea,
For harmony, and clarity.
