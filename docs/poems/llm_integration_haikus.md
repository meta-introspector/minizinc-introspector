title: LLM Integration Haikus
summary: This poem presents a series of haikus describing the integration of LLM agents, emphasizing their role in augmenting human wisdom, the use of FFI for in-process collaboration with MiniZinc, and their contribution to the OODA loop for defining the future.

art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Augment, Not Replace," a stylized LLM agent (perhaps a glowing brain) assisting a human hand, both working in harmony on a balanced scale. For "FFI's Bridge," a glowing bridge connecting a MiniZinc model and an AI agent, with lines of FFI code forming the bridge. For "OODA's Loop," a dynamic OODA loop diagram with a human hand guiding the "Orient" and "Decide" phases, leading to a clear, luminous future. The overall feeling should be one of intelligent collaboration, seamless integration, and purposeful progress.

## LLM Integration Haikus

### Augment, Not Replace
LLM assists,
Human wisdom, still the guide,
Balance, strong and wise.

### FFI's Bridge
In-process, deep,
MiniZinc and agent meet,
Insights, now unfold.

### OODA's Loop
Orient, decide,
Human touch, a guiding hand,
Future, now defined.
