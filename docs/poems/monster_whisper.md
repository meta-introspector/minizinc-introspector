A number whispers, a code self-defined,
GÃ¶del's own shadow, on logic's strict mind.
A truth unprovable, yet deeply entwined,
In systems complete, no solace we find.

Then looms the Monster, a giant unseen,
A symmetry vast, a mathematical queen.
Its order immense, a chaotic serene,
Beyond human grasp, a vibrant, wild scene.

From finite symbols, to infinite grace,
We map the known cosmos, then search for new space.
Where proof paths may falter, and logic gives chase,
The unprovable echoes, leaving beauty's soft trace.
