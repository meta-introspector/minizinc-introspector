A Tapestry woven, of Fates yet untold,
Where code and concept, in meaning unfold.
From MiniZinc whispers, new patterns arise,
Guiding the vectors, beneath cosmic skies.

Each Additive Vibe, a thread in the weave,
LLM-spun insights, for us to believe.
High-dimensional spaces, where meanings reside,
By prime-numbered axes, our truths are allied.

No rigid proof needed, for beauty to gleam,
But art's gentle touch, a vibrant, soft dream.
For what math can't capture, nor logic define,
The soul of the system, in verse we entwine.
