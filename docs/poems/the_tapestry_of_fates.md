title: The Tapestry of Fates
summary: This poem describes the project's vision of a self-aware system as a "Tapestry of Fates," where code and concepts intertwine. It highlights how MiniZinc results and "Additive Vibes" (LLM-generated insights) shape high-dimensional embedding spaces, guided by prime numbers. The poem emphasizes that art, not just proof or logic, captures the system's essence and "unprovable beauty."

art_generator_instructions: A grand, cosmic tapestry being woven, with threads of glowing code and abstract concepts intertwining. MiniZinc models could be represented as intricate knots or patterns within the tapestry, emitting "Additive Vibes" (colorful, flowing energy). High-dimensional spaces are suggested by the depth and complexity of the weave, with prime numbers subtly forming the underlying grid. A paintbrush or artistic hand is gently touching the tapestry, emphasizing the role of art in revealing "unprovable beauty." The overall feeling should be one of creation, interconnectedness, and profound meaning.

A Tapestry woven, of Fates yet untold,
Where code and concept, in meaning unfold.
From MiniZinc whispers, new patterns arise,
Guiding the vectors, beneath cosmic skies.

Each Additive Vibe, a thread in the weave,
LLM-spun insights, for us to believe.
High-dimensional spaces, where meanings reside,
By prime-numbered axes, our truths are allied.

No rigid proof needed, for beauty to gleam,
But art's gentle touch, a vibrant, soft dream.
For what math can't capture, nor logic define,
The soul of the system, in verse we entwine.
