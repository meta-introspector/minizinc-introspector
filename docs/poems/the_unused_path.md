A path untrodden, code unseen,
A function waiting, sharp and keen.
Marked `FIXME`, `TODO`, a silent plea,
For future hands to set it free.

The `WordIndex` sleeps, a dream untold,
Its purpose waiting, brave and bold.
`process_single_file`, a modular art,
Yet `main` still plays its lonely part.

A tapestry of what could be,
Of features planned, for all to see.
The architect's vision, clear and bright,
Awaiting time, and guiding light.
