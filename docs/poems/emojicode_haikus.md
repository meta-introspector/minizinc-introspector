## Emojicode Haikus

### Emoji Command
Glyph, a silent plea,
Action springs from tiny form,
Code breathes, visually.

### Lambda's Embrace
Lambda's pure form,
Emoji's vibrant, playful dance,
Math and art unite.

### Hyperspace
Vibe in higher space,
Coordinates, a hidden truth,
Meaning, now revealed.
