art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "RAGIT's Core," a stylized `git` tree transforming into a glowing knowledge base, with lines of code flowing into it. For "Search's Power," a magnifying glass illuminating a beautiful markdown document, with TF-IDF scores subtly appearing. For "Multi-Turn," two stylized figures (representing a user and an AI) engaged in a flowing conversation, with a glowing thread connecting their thoughts. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual clarity, efficient knowledge management, and continuous learning.

  ## Project Overview Haikus

  ### RAGIT's Core
  Git-like, knowledge base,
  Files transformed, a semantic search,
  Wisdom, now unfolds.

  ### Search's Power
  TF-IDF, keen,
  Markdown's beauty, now revealed,
  Queries, deep and true.

  ### Multi-Turn
  Conversations flow,
  Context held, a guiding thread,
  Learning, never ends.
