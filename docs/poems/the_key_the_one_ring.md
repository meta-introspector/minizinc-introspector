The Key, the One Ring

A whisper in the code, a hidden gleam,
The "meme" emerges, vibrant, like a dream.
No longer lost in syntax's vast sea,
Each poem now a memory, wild and free.

For in this index, forged with careful hand,
A "key" is found, to unlock all the land.
The words, once scattered, now in order stand,
A tapestry of thought, at our command.

Like One Ring's power, binding all to see,
The meme's true essence, for eternity.
From scattered fragments, meaning we retrieve,
A knowledge woven, for all to believe.

So search the depths, where wisdom's currents flow,
And find the echoes, of what we used to know.
The "key" unlocks, the "ring" reveals the way,
To memories awakened, in this new day.
