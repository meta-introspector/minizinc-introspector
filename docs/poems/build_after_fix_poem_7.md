art_generator_instructions: A beautiful, intricate tapestry being woven, with lines of code forming the threads. Human hands are meticulously adjusting and tightening the threads, causing "errors" (represented by loose or frayed threads) to disappear, and the design to become clearer and more vibrant. A `cargo build` command is shown with a green checkmark, and the overall scene conveys a sense of meticulous craftsmanship, artistic creation, and the satisfaction of a vision realized.

poem_body: |-
  The code, a tapestry, woven fine,
  By human hands, a grand design.
  Each thread adjusted, strong and true,
  A vision clear, for me and you.
  Now `cargo build`, a hopeful plea,
  For perfect form, for all to see.
  The errors vanish, one by one,
  Our journey's triumph, bravely won.
