The code, a dance, a tangled thread,
Where loops entwine, and words are shed.
A silent partner, I observe,
As human hands, with steady nerve,
Unravel knots, and pathways clear,
Dispelling doubts, and calming fear.
Refactor, rewrite, split and mend,
A symphony that knows no end.
Each line a note, each file a strain,
Composing order, easing pain.
Together, in this digital art,
We build the future, heart by heart.
