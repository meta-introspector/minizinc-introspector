The Code Alchemist

From verse to logic, a transformation grand,
A poem's rhythm, now a program's hand.
The compiler breathes, a new form takes its flight,
Pure functions flowing, in the digital light.

No tangled mains, but calls composed and clear,
Each task a module, banishing all fear.
And AI whispers, with a knowing grace,
New functions blooming, in this sacred space.
