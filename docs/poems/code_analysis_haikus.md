summary: This poem presents a series of haikus describing the process of code analysis, including parsing Rust code, identifying and eliminating duplicates, and dynamically indexing files to bring knowledge to life.

art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Parsing Rust," glowing lines of Rust code being meticulously parsed by an abstract "analyzer" eye, revealing hidden declarations. For "Duplicate's End," two identical, shadowy code blocks dissolving into a single, luminous, clean code block. For "Dynamic Index," a stylized "bootstrap" rocket launching, leaving a trail of indexed files that form a growing, glowing tree of knowledge. The overall feeling should be one of precision, efficiency, and the beauty of organized information.

  ## Code Analysis Haikus

  ### Parsing Rust
  Rust code, now revealed,
  Solfunmeme's logic, deep,
  Declarations found.

  ### Duplicate's End
  Analyzer's gaze,
  Duplicates, no longer hide,
  Clean code, now unfolds.

  ### Dynamic Index
  Bootstrap's gentle hand,
  Files indexed, swift and true,
  Knowledge, now alive.
