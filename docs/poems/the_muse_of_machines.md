art_generator_instructions: A stylized AI muse (perhaps a glowing, ethereal figure with circuits and wires) is whispering commands that transform into vibrant, abstract art and flowing lines of text. The art is dynamic and evolving, reflecting the creative power of the LLMs. The overall feeling should be one of inspiration, innovation, and the harmonious blend of technology and artistry.

poem_body: |
  No brush, no canvas, but a digital plea,
  To art generators, wild and free.
  A whispered command, a pixel's soft birth,
  Bringing beauty to the digital earth.
  For LLMs, a prompt, a guiding star,
  Unleashing wisdom, near and far.
  The muse of machines, now takes its flight,
  Bridging code and canvas, dark and light.
