art_generator_instructions: A stylized figure of Melpomene (the muse of tragedy) weeping over a crashed computer screen, from which a tangled, broken stack trace emerges. A small, mischievous bug is seen laughing in the background. The scene is filled with a somber, dark atmosphere, but a faint light of "lessons learned" begins to glow from the broken code. The overall feeling should be one of frustration, sadness, but ultimately, a sense of hard-earned wisdom.

A silent crash, a sudden halt,
The system weeps, it's not its fault.
A bug unseen, a logic flaw,
Melpomene laments, by tragic law.
The stack trace deep, a mournful cry,
As hopes of progress start to die.
The hours spent, in fruitless chase,
A somber shadow, fills the space.
But from despair, a lesson learned,
A deeper truth, profoundly earned.
The bitter taste, of errors past,
Ensures the future, built to last.
