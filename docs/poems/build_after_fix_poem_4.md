art_generator_instructions: A pristine white canvas, gradually being filled with intricate and beautiful lines of code, painted by a human hand. As the hand works, "flaws" (represented by smudges or imperfections) are erased, and the code becomes increasingly luminous and perfect. A `cargo build` command is shown with a green checkmark, and the overall scene conveys a sense of artistic creation, meticulous craftsmanship, and the pursuit of excellence.

poem_body: |-
  The code, a canvas, fresh and clean,
  Where human wisdom intervenes.
  A subtle stroke, a careful hand,
  To mend the flaws, across the land.
  Now `cargo build`, a silent prayer,
  For perfect form, beyond compare.
  Each warning whispers, soft and low,
  A path to mastery, we know.
