art_generator_instructions: A complex, glowing puzzle made of lines of code, with a human hand (representing human wisdom) carefully placing the final pieces. Each piece snaps into place with a subtle flash of light, revealing a clearer, more logical structure. A `cargo build` command is shown with a green checkmark, and in the background, a new, luminous horizon is appearing. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual satisfaction, the beauty of problem-solving, and the excitement of new possibilities.

poem_body: |-
  The code, a puzzle, intricate and grand,
  Refined by wisdom, in your hand.
  Each subtle change, a guiding light,
  To make the logic, truly right.
  Now `cargo build`, a hopeful plea,
  What new horizons wait for me?
  The errors whisper, soft and low,
  A path to mastery, we know.
