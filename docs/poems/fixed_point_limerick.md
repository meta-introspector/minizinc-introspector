art_generator_instructions: A stylized system (perhaps a complex, glowing mechanism) is iteratively moving and refining itself, gradually converging towards a central, luminous "fixed point." The overall feeling should be one of elegant precision, purposeful movement, and the satisfaction of achieving a stable, desired state.

  ## The Fixed Point's Delight

  A system, so grand and so neat,
  Sought a fixed point, both stable and sweet.
  Through iterations it flew,
  Converging anew,
  Its purpose, at last, made complete.
