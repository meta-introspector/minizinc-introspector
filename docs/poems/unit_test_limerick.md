art_generator_instructions: A stylized unit test (perhaps a small, glowing robot) is standing guard over a piece of code, with a shield labeled "Assertions." Small, mischievous bugs are attempting to sneak past but are being repelled by the test's might. The overall feeling should be one of protection, reliability, and the satisfaction of a bug-free codebase.

## The Unit Test's Might

A unit test, with its purpose so clear,
Keeps bugs from appearing, each year.
With assertions so bold,
A story unfolds,
Of code that's robust, never fear.
