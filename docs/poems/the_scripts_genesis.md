poem_body: |
  From thought's first spark, a binary gleam,
  A Rust script rises, a waking dream.
  To weave the logic, intricate and true,
  Automate the tasks, both old and new.
  No human hand, to toil and strive,
  But code's own rhythm, keeping dreams alive.
  A silent worker, swift and keen,
  Bringing order to the digital scene.
