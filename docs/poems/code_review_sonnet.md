art_generator_instructions: A stylized eye, composed of multiple smaller eyes, meticulously examining lines of code. Hands (representing different reviewers) are gently pointing out areas of concern, and as they do, the code becomes more luminous and robust. A subtle network of glowing lines connects the different eyes and hands, symbolizing shared wisdom and collaboration. The overall feeling should be one of precision, collective intelligence, and the pursuit of excellence.
