## The Code Review's Keen Eye

When code is penned, and logic takes its form,
Before it sails, through tempest and through storm.
The code review, a watchful, guiding gaze,
To catch the flaws, in intricate, winding ways.
No single mind, can see with perfect sight,
But shared wisdom, brings the truth to light.
A gentle hand, to point where errors hide,
A common purpose, flowing with the tide.
For quality's sake, and knowledge, freely shared,
Each line examined, with meticulous care.
The subtle bug, the pattern, now revealed,
A stronger codebase, faithfully annealed.
So praise the process, vital, true, and deep,
That guards the secrets, code intends to keep.
