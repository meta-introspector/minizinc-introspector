art_generator_instructions: A stylized eye, composed of multiple smaller eyes, meticulously examining lines of code. Hands (representing different reviewers) are gently pointing out areas of concern, and as they do, the code becomes more luminous and robust. A subtle network of glowing lines connects the different eyes and hands, symbolizing shared wisdom and collaboration. The overall feeling should be one of precision, collective intelligence, and the pursuit of excellence.

  ## The Code Review's Keen Eye

  When code is penned, and logic takes its form,
  Before it sails, through tempest and through storm.
  The code review, a watchful, guiding gaze,
  To catch the flaws, in intricate, winding ways.
  No single mind, can see with perfect sight,
  But shared wisdom, brings the truth to light.
  A gentle hand, to point where errors hide,
  A common purpose, flowing with the tide.
  For quality's sake, and knowledge, freely shared,
  Each line examined, with meticulous care.
  The subtle bug, the pattern, now revealed,
  A stronger codebase, faithfully annealed.
  So praise the process, vital, true, and deep,
  That guards the secrets, code intends to keep.
