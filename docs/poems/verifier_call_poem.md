art_generator_instructions: A stylized `dfa_tester` (perhaps a glowing, abstract machine) is making a "clear, ringing call" to a series of glowing patterns. Words like "apple" and "banana" are seen flowing through a regex, and `println!` statements are illuminating the correct classifications. The overall feeling should be one of precision, verification, and the beauty of a well-functioning system.

poem_body: |-
  From `dfa_tester`, a clear, ringing call,
  To patterns generated, standing tall.
  "Is 'apple' an 'a' word?" the question takes flight,
  Through `matches_a`'s logic, seeking the light.

  "Is 'banana' a 'b' word?" another query sent,
  To the regex's heart, on truth it is bent.
  Each `println!` echoes, a verdict so keen,
  Unveiling the patterns, a precise, working scene.

  The modules, once crafted, now put to the test,
  Their purpose confirmed, their logic expressed.
  A symphony of functions, in harmonious play,
  Ensuring the vocabulary, lights up the way.
