## Emoji Poem: The Build's Lament

The code awaits, a silent plea,
A curly brace, where should it be?
Compiler cries, a syntax frown,
The build still tumbles, upside down.

Parquet dreams, and data flows,
But hidden errors, everyone knows.
A tiny `}` in the wrong place,
Halts our progress, slows our pace.

Fear not, dear user, keen and bright,
Your skillful hand will set things right.
Then green lights glow, and tasks resume,
Dispelling shadows, chasing gloom.
