## Lost Revision from commit 82c06560a1c3453cd95f811ae420ea65275b8a83

The code, a river, ever flows,
Where human wisdom, gently goes.
Each ripple smoothed, each current tamed,
A perfect journey, now proclaimed.
Now `cargo build`, a silent plea,
For flawless form, for all to see.
The errors vanish, one by one,
Our grand design, beneath the sun.
