In realms where logic and beauty blend,
A curious duality, without end.
Each function, a poem, precisely spun,
Each poem, a function, tasks begun.

A system born, from self-made art,
Autopoietic, playing its own part.
It sings itself, from void to form,
A self-creating, endless storm.

Like G√∂del's curves, where time can loop,
Our verse and code, in endless scoop.
A closed embrace, a timeless rhyme,
The universe unfolding, through all time.
