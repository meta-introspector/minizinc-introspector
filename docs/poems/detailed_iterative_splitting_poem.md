art_generator_instructions: A complex, glowing problem (perhaps a tangled knot of lines) being meticulously and iteratively split into smaller, more manageable pieces by a series of precise cuts. A clock is ticking in the background, but the process is calm and focused. Each split reveals a clearer, more luminous structure, leading to a sense of order and accomplishment. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual precision, methodical progress, and the beauty of breaking down complexity.

The clock's stern gaze, a ten-second span,
Demands a new, meticulous plan.
The problem's bulk, we'll halve with care,
Then start the timer, if we dare.
Should time betray, and patience wane,
We'll split again, through sun and rain.
With verbose whispers, truth revealed,
Until the perfect slice is sealed.
A fractal quest, a patient art,
To conquer time, and play our part.
