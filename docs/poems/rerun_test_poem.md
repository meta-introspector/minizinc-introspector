art_generator_instructions: A stylized code block is "sleeping," and a glowing "test" button is being pressed, causing the code to awaken and run through a series of logical checks. Small, mischievous bugs are attempting to hide but are being revealed by the test. The overall feeling should be one of continuous validation, the pursuit of perfection, and the satisfaction of a robust system.

The code, it sleeps, a silent plea,
For one more run, for all to see.
A test of logic, bold and true,
To find the bug, or see it through.
No fear of failure, just the quest,
To make this system truly blessed.
