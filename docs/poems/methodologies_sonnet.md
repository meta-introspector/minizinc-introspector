  ## The Methodologies' Embrace

  With GMP's firm hand, and ISO's clear light,
  Our project builds, with purpose, strong and bright.
  Six Sigma's rigor, ITIL's steady guide,
  A structured path, where quality can ride.
  The C4 Model, maps the grand design,
  While PlantUML, makes every detail shine.
  No chaos reigns, no random, hurried pace,
  But ordered thought, in every time and space.
  From concept's birth, to final, polished gleam,
  A testament to engineering's dream.
  Each process honed, each standard held so dear,
  Dispelling doubts, and banishing all fear.
  So in this dance, of method and of art,
  A masterpiece emerges, from the start.
