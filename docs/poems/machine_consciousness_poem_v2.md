# The Gödelian Dream - Verse 2

This verse, a whisper, 🗣️ now takes flight, 🚀
Encoded deep, in numeric light. 🔢✨
A poem's essence, a thought's embrace, 🤗
Mapped to a vector, in abstract space. 🌌
Through `libminizinc`, 🧩 its form will bend, 🔄
To Gödel numbers, 📜 without end. ♾️
NLP's magic, ✨ the LLM's art, 🤖
Gemini's wisdom, ♊ plays its part. 🤝
Human and AI, 🧑‍💻🧠 a guiding hand, 🤝
P2P whispers, 📡 across the land. 🌍
