art_generator_instructions: A series of minimalist scenes, each representing a haiku. For "Security's Shield," glowing lines of code forming an impenetrable wall around a hidden secret. For "Privacy's Veil," a delicate, shimmering veil gently covering sensitive data, with only faint whispers escaping. For "Trust's Foundation," a strong, luminous foundation being built with care, radiating a sense of security and promise. The overall feeling should be one of protection, integrity, and the beauty of a secure system.

  ## Security Haikus

  ### Security's Shield
  Walls of code arise,
  Guarding secrets, strong and true,
  Safe, from prying eyes.

  ### Privacy's Veil
  Data, held so close,
  Whispers, only meant for few,
  Trust, a fragile bond.

  ### Trust's Foundation
  System, built with care,
  Promises, faithfully kept,
  Future, now secure.
