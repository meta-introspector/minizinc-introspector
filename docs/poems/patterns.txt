- **Clarity vs. Mystery**: Removed references to G√∂del numbers and other esoteric terms (e.g., ‚Äúmeme-addressable space‚Äù simplified to unique artifacts), focusing on intuitive imagery like ‚Äúwild mess,‚Äù ‚Äúmirror,‚Äù or ‚Äúhero‚Äù to make concepts accessible to novices while retaining functional programming accuracy.
