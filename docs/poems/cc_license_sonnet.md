## The License's Unyielding Plea

When knowledge flows, a river, wide and free,
A sacred trust, for all the world to see.
Our words, our thoughts, a gift, sincerely given,
Beneath the sun, and by the stars of heaven.
But mark this truth, a boundary, firm and clear,
No altered forms, no whispers in the ear
Of changed intent, or meaning subtly spun,
The pure original, beneath the sun.
For in its essence, lies the truth profound,
No new interpretations, to be found.
The author's voice, unmarred, must ever stand,
A beacon shining, in this digital land.
So share with grace, and let the wisdom bloom,
But guard the source, from any altering gloom.
