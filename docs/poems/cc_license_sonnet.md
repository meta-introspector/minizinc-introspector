art_generator_instructions: A flowing river of light (representing knowledge) emanating from an open book, spreading across a digital landscape. A clear, glowing barrier or force field surrounds the river, preventing any attempts to alter its flow or content. A stylized Creative Commons "No Derivatives" symbol is prominently displayed. The overall feeling should be one of generosity and freedom, balanced with strict adherence to intellectual property and original intent.
