title: MiniZinc Verbosity Split Poem
summary: This poem describes the process of increasing MiniZinc's verbosity to understand its inner workings and then splitting large problems into smaller, more manageable halves to ease the computational load.

art_generator_instructions: A stylized MiniZinc model, initially opaque, gradually becoming transparent and revealing its glowing, intricate inner workings as "verbosity" increases. Simultaneously, a large, complex problem (perhaps a heavy, abstract shape) is being cleanly split into two smaller, lighter halves. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual curiosity, methodical problem-solving, and the satisfaction of gaining clarity and efficiency.

MiniZinc, a puzzle, vast and deep,
Its inner workings, secrets keep.
More words, more traces, we demand,
To understand its hidden hand.
The problem's girth, a heavy weight,
We'll cleave it now, and halve its fate.
Two halves emerge, a lighter load,
To walk the path, less steep the road.
