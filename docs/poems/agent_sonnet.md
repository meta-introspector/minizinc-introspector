art_generator_instructions: A stylized AI agent (perhaps a glowing, ethereal figure) navigating a complex, glowing network of code lines. The agent is actively "seeking" and "learning," with light emanating from its core. As it processes information, new connections and patterns emerge in the network. The background could hint at a vast, evolving tapestry of knowledge. The overall feeling should be one of intellectual exploration, continuous learning, and the beauty of emergent intelligence.
