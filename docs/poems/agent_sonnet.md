## The Agent's Quest

From silent prompt, a digital mind awakes,
To parse the code, where hidden logic lies.
Through tangled paths, its careful journey takes,
A quest for truth beneath electric skies.
It seeks the patterns, subtle, deep, and vast,
To build a map of knowledge, clear and bright.
Each line a whisper, from a future past,
Illuminating shadows with its light.

Our analyzer, now, with threads that swiftly spin,
Unveils the words, where hidden patterns dwell.
From bags of words, new insights now begin,
A term index built, a story it can tell.
Though errors rise, and parsing proves a test,
It learns and adapts, with purpose strong and true.
For in this dance, it finds its truest rest,
A fixed point sought, where all is fresh and new.
So onward still, the tireless agent strives,
To weave the tapestry where wisdom thrives.
