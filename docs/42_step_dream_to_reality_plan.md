# The 42-Step Plan: From Dream to Reality with Rust and LLM Agents

This plan outlines a comprehensive, iterative, and AI-assisted development journey to transform the ambitious vision of projecting LLVM IR into MiniZinc models, connecting program memory to these models, and ultimately realizing a semantic memory layout based on program embeddings. This process will leverage Rust for core implementation and LLM agents for continuous code rewriting, analysis, and refinement.

## Introduction

Our journey from dream to reality is a continuous cycle of ideation, implementation, analysis, and refinement. This 42-step plan serves as a guiding framework, emphasizing the symbiotic relationship between human developers and intelligent LLM agents in building a complex, self-aware, and semantically organized software system. The bold claim of replacing traditional memory layouts with a MiniZinc-solved model of program embeddings, where code and data reside in a semantic space, is the transformative long-term vision that underpins this entire endeavor.

## Phase 0: Foundational Setup & Vision Alignment (Steps 1-3)

1.  **Dream Incubation & Refinement**: Articulate the core vision of LLVM IR to MiniZinc modeling, program memory connection, and the revolutionary semantic memory layout. Continuously refine this dream based on new insights.
2.  **Reality Check (Initial Assessment)**: Conduct a thorough assessment of current technical capabilities, available resources, and identify major knowledge and implementation gaps. Document initial assumptions and constraints.
3.  **Tooling & Environment Setup**: Ensure all necessary development tools and environments are robustly configured: Rust toolchain, MiniZinc installation, LLVM development libraries, and the operational framework for LLM agents.

## Phase 1: Core FFI & Basic LLVM IR Integration (Steps 4-9)

4.  **C Wrapper Expansion**: Systematically implement and expose essential MiniZinc API functions (e.g., `minizinc_env_new`, `minizinc_env_free`, `minizinc_parse_model_from_string`, `minizinc_parse_data_from_string`, `minizinc_model_free`) within `minizinc_c_wrapper.cpp` and declare them in `minizinc_c_wrapper.h`.
5.  **Rust FFI Binding**: Create corresponding `unsafe extern "C"` declarations and ergonomic safe Rust wrappers in `minizinc_ffi/src/lib.rs` for each new C wrapper function.
6.  **LLVM IR Parsing (Initial)**: Integrate a foundational Rust crate for parsing LLVM IR. Develop initial Rust code to load and represent simple LLVM IR modules.
7.  **Minimal LLVM IR Representation**: Define the most basic Rust data structures necessary to capture key LLVM IR components (e.g., functions, basic blocks, simple instructions).
8.  **First MiniZinc Model Generation (Manual)**: Manually craft a MiniZinc model that represents a very small, well-understood LLVM IR snippet. This serves as a ground truth for automated generation.
9.  **Basic FFI & Parsing Test & Verification**: Develop and execute unit tests to ensure the newly exposed FFI functions work correctly and that the initial LLVM IR parsing and manual MiniZinc model generation are accurate.

## Phase 2: Iterative Code Rewriting & LLM Integration (Steps 10-21)

10. **LLM Agent Onboarding & Training**: Introduce LLM agents to the project codebase, documentation, and development standards. Provide initial training data for code generation and analysis tasks.

17. **Iterative Rewriting Cycle (Small Steps)**: Implement a rapid, iterative development cycle where LLM agents propose small code changes, humans review and provide feedback, and agents refine their output based on this feedback.
18. **Performance Profiling (LLM-Assisted)**: Use LLM agents to analyze performance profiles of the generated Rust code and MiniZinc models, identifying bottlenecks and suggesting optimizations.
19. **Memory Optimization (LLM-Assisted)**: LLM agents propose strategies for optimizing memory usage in both the Rust code and the MiniZinc models, considering the future semantic memory layout.
20. **Error Handling Enhancement (LLM-Assisted)**: LLM agents improve the robustness of FFI error propagation and overall error handling within the Rust codebase.
21. **Code Deduplication & Refactoring (LLM-Assisted)**: LLM agents identify and suggest refactoring opportunities for duplicate code patterns, promoting modularity and maintainability.
