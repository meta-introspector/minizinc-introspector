# Vision: Orchestrated Gemini Execution in a Clean Environment

This document outlines the refined vision for launching and managing Gemini within a controlled, isolated environment, leveraging our existing infrastructure.

## Core Objectives:

1.  **Isolated Environment Provisioning:** Utilize GitHub Actions runners (orchestrated by `mini-act`) to create a fresh, clean execution environment for each Gemini task. This ensures reproducibility and eliminates interference from previous runs.
2.  **Gemini Launch and Task Assignment:** Launch a Gemini instance within this isolated environment, providing it with a specific, well-defined task.
3.  **Limited Context Operation:** Gemini will operate with a deliberately limited and curated context, ensuring it focuses only on the information relevant to its assigned task. This "backpack full of goodies" will contain precisely what's needed, and nothing more.
4.  **Time and Step-Bound Execution:** Each Gemini job will be constrained by:
    *   **N minutes:** A maximum time limit for the entire job execution.
    *   **N steps:** A maximum number of discrete actions or iterations Gemini can perform.
    These constraints are crucial for resource management, preventing runaway processes, and enabling efficient iteration during development and testing.
5.  **Full Tracing and Recording:** Implement comprehensive logging and recording mechanisms for every aspect of Gemini's execution within the environment. This includes:
    *   **Input/Output:** All data provided to and generated by Gemini.
    *   **Internal State Changes:** Snapshots of Gemini's internal reasoning process (if feasible and relevant).
    *   **Tool Usage:** Records of every tool call, its arguments, and its output.
    *   **Environment Interactions:** Any shell commands executed, file system operations, or network requests.
    *   **Timestamps:** Precise timing for each step and overall execution.
6.  **Failure Analysis and Debugging:** The detailed tracing and recording will enable thorough post-mortem analysis of any failures or unexpected behavior. This data will be invaluable for debugging, improving Gemini's performance, and refining its task execution strategies.

## Implementation Considerations:

*   **`mini-act` as Orchestrator:** `mini-act` will be extended to manage the lifecycle of the Gemini process, enforce time/step limits, and collect tracing data.
*   **"Backpack" Mechanism:** A standardized method for packaging and delivering the "limited context" (e.g., specific files, environment variables, pre-configured tools) to Gemini's isolated workspace.
*   **Tracing Integration:** Gemini's internal logging and external interactions will be piped to a central logging system or file, which `mini-act` can then collect and upload as an `artifact`.
*   **Error Handling and Reporting:** Robust error handling within Gemini and `mini-act` to gracefully manage failures and report them effectively.

This vision aims to create a highly controllable, observable, and analyzable environment for developing and testing Gemini's capabilities, ensuring we can systematically improve its performance and reliability.
