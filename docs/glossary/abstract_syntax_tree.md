# Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)

An Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of source code written in a programming language. Each node in the tree denotes a construct occurring in the source code.

In this project, ASTs are a fundamental data structure for representing code in a form that can be analyzed, transformed, and generated by MiniZinc models. Specifically, MiniZinc models like `lambda_embedding_v1.mzn` represent ASTs using arrays of variables, where each variable corresponds to a node's type, value, or child pointers. This numerical representation allows MiniZinc to apply constraints and solve for missing or "masked" parts of the AST, enabling **token/AST regeneration**.
