# Lambda Embedding

Lambda Embedding refers to the process of representing lambda calculus terms (which are fundamental to functional programming and formal logic) as numerical structures within MiniZinc models. These numerical representations, often in the form of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) mapped to arrays of integers or other discrete types, allow for the application of constraint programming techniques to analyze, manipulate, and generate lambda terms.

In this project, Lambda Embedding is crucial for:
*   **Formalizing Code Structures**: Translating abstract code concepts into a mathematically tractable form.
*   **Enabling MiniZinc Manipulation**: Allowing MiniZinc to reason about and solve for properties of lambda terms, including their **regeneration** from masked or partial forms.
*   **Connecting to Hyperspace**: Linking the structure of lambda terms to high-dimensional embedding spaces, where their semantic properties can be explored and optimized.
