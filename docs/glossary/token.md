# Token

In the context of programming languages, a token is a sequence of characters that represents a single, indivisible unit of meaning. Examples include keywords (e.g., `if`, `while`), identifiers (variable names), operators (e.g., `+`, `-`), and literals (e.g., `123`, `"hello"`).

In this project's approach to code generation and analysis, tokens can be treated as fundamental building blocks that form Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). MiniZinc models can operate on sequences of tokens, or on the individual components of an AST that correspond to tokens. The concept of **token regeneration** involves using MiniZinc to predict or complete missing tokens within a sequence or AST based on defined constraints and contextual information.
