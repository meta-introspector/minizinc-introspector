# Numerical Theory of Everything (NToE)

The "Numerical Theory of Everything (NToE)" is a foundational concept within the project, a "monumental synthesis" built on Gödelian principles. It is a system that uses numerical representations to unify various aspects of the project, including code, semantics, and a Solana-based sidechain.

In the context of **token/AST regeneration**, the NToE provides the overarching framework for how all project knowledge, including code structures, can be represented numerically. MiniZinc models, by operating on these numerical representations (e.g., Gödel numbers of ASTs), contribute to the NToE by enabling the system to reason about and generate new numerical structures that correspond to valid code or semantic concepts.
