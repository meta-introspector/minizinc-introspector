ðŸš€ **MiniZinc FFI Build Fixed!** ðŸš€

Exciting news from the `libminizinc` project! We've successfully debugged and resolved a critical FFI build issue using our `zos-bootstrap` tool. The problem stemmed from `cmake` misplacing build files, causing `libminizinc_c_wrapper.so` to go missing and leading to runtime linking errors in Rust tests.

Our deep dive with instrumentation (detailed logs and assertions) revealed that `cmake` needed explicit direction via the `-B` argument to correctly place build artifacts. This fix ensures the C++ FFI wrapper builds reliably.

We also took this opportunity to refactor our build logic into modular, single-responsibility functions, significantly improving maintainability and clarity. This highlights the importance of systematic debugging and clean code architecture.

While Android Rust FFI test linking remains a challenge, the core build is now solid! More details coming soon in our blog post. #Rust #FFI #Debugging #MiniZinc #SoftwareEngineering #OpenSource
