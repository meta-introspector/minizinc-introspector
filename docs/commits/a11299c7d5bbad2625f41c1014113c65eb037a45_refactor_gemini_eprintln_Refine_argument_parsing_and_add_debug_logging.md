refactor(gemini_eprintln): Refine argument parsing and add debug logging

This commit refines the argument parsing and handling logic within the `gemini_eprintln!` procedural macro.

Key changes include:
- Enhanced parsing of named and positional arguments in `gemini_eprintln_input.rs` to improve flexibility and correctness.
- Added extensive `eprintln!` debug statements throughout `lib.rs` to provide detailed tracing of the macro's execution flow, aiding in further development and debugging.
- Refined the logic for filling placeholders, allowing for more robust argument resolution.
- Added `#[derive(Debug)]` to `PlaceholderType` for improved debugging capabilities.

This work contributes to the stability and maintainability of the `gemini_eprintln!` macro, which is central to the project's logging and communication strategy.
