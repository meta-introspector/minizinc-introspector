feat: Add vibe_analyzer crate and update CRQ commit histories

This commit introduces the new `vibe_analyzer` crate, designed for code analysis and searching, along with related dependency updates in `Cargo.lock` and `Cargo.toml`.

Additionally, this commit adds "Commit History" sections to several existing Change Request (CRQ) documents, including `crq_generic_git_tool.md`, `crq_launchpad_dynamic_stages.md`, `crq_launchpad_workflow_enhancements.md`, `crq_p2p_comms_system.md`, `crq_tmux_view_tool.md`, `crq_tmux_watch_workflow.md`, and `docs/sops/crq_updater_qa_sop.md`. These updates link to commit `ac86ef2eda7bd9de1a4ed252273b284b8d682d16`, which introduced the Tmux Workflow and Debugging SOP.
