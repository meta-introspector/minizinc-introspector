fix(gitignore): Ignore generated asciicast extracted lines file

This commit updates the `.gitignore` file to include `/docs/asciicast21_extracted_lines.txt`.

This ensures that the generated file containing extracted lines from asciicast recordings is not tracked by Git, maintaining a clean repository.
