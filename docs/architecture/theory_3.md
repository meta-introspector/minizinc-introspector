## Theory 3: Gemini CLI as the Orchestrator of Collective Intelligence

The Gemini CLI will serve as the primary facilitator for this ambitious endeavor. It will achieve this by:

1.  **SOP Generation and Guidance:** Writing and refining Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to meticulously guide the entire process, ensuring clarity, consistency, and reproducibility.
2.  **Human-in-the-Loop Orchestration:** Guiding the process with human assistance, leveraging collective intelligence and expertise.
3.  **Engagement and Participation:** Making the process so engaging and accessible that it inspires widespread participation and collaboration.
4.  **Virtual Credit Compensation:** Implementing a system of virtual credits to compensate contributors for their computational resources (CPU, GPU, disk, and RAM) and network usage, fostering a decentralized and incentivized development ecosystem.
