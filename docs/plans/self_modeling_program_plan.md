# Plan: Developing a Self-Recreating, Self-Modeling Rust Program

## Objective

The primary objective is to develop a Rust program capable of self-recreation, modeling its own language elements down to assembly, simulating execution, profiling performance, and integrating an LLM and SAT solver for every instruction. This ambitious endeavor aims to create a computationally self-aware system that can analyze, optimize, and even synthesize its own code.

## Leveraging Existing Project Components

This plan leverages several existing components and conceptual frameworks within the `libminizinc` project to achieve the objective:

1.  **`minizinc_ffi` Crate**: This crate provides robust Rust FFI bindings to the MiniZinc C++ core. It will be instrumental for:
    *   **Modeling MiniZinc Language Elements**: Parsing MiniZinc models and traversing their Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
    *   **SAT Solver Integration**: Interacting with MiniZinc's backend solvers to reason about code properties and optimize instructions.
    *   **Execution Simulation**: Potentially simulating MiniZinc model execution to understand code behavior.

2.  **`doc_to_minizinc_data` Crate**: This tool extracts words from source code and documentation, generating initial 8D numerical embeddings in MiniZinc-compatible `.dzn` files. It will be used for:
    *   **Numerical Representation Generation**: Providing the raw data (embeddings) of the Rust program's own source code and documentation for MiniZinc analysis.

3.  **`minizinc_introspector` Crate**: While primarily for C++ AST analysis using `clang-rs`, its approach to robust parsing and AST traversal patterns will serve as a valuable reference for the Rust program's own AST analysis using `syn`.

4.  **Conceptual Frameworks (SOPs and Plans)**:
    *   **`quasi_meta_introspection_sop.tex`**: Provides the overarching conceptual framework for computational self-awareness, numerical embeddings, LLM-driven analysis, and self-reflection. It emphasizes the "add-only, never edit" philosophy, which will guide code evolution.
    *   **`project_wide_ast_analysis.tex`**: Outlines the theoretical basis for holistic AST analysis, treating code elements as "solutions" to be optimized by MiniZinc. This will inform the design of MiniZinc models for code analysis and synthesis.

## Phased Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Self-Modeling and MiniZinc Integration

*   **Objective**: Extend the existing Rust program to deeply model its own Rust code and integrate with MiniZinc for basic analysis.
*   **Actions**: 
    *   **Refine Rust AST Traversal**: Enhance the `model_and_generate_asm` function (or a new module) to extract more detailed information from the Rust AST using `syn`, beyond just function and variable declarations. This includes control flow, data types, function calls, etc.
    *   **Generate MiniZinc Representation of Rust AST**: Develop a component that translates the extracted Rust AST information into a MiniZinc model. This will involve defining MiniZinc data structures to represent Rust constructs (e.g., `RustFn`, `RustVar`, `RustStmt`).
    *   **Integrate `doc_to_minizinc_data`**: Modify the Rust program to call `doc_to_minizinc_data` (or integrate its logic) to generate embeddings of its own source code.
    *   **Basic MiniZinc Analysis**: Create a simple MiniZinc model that takes the Rust AST representation and embeddings as input. Initially, this model could perform basic checks (e.g., identify duplicate code patterns, simple code metrics).
    *   **FFI Interaction**: Use the `minizinc_ffi` crate to load and solve the MiniZinc model from within the Rust program, and extract basic results.

### Phase 2: LLM and SAT Solver Integration for Code Optimization

*   **Objective**: Integrate LLM and SAT solver capabilities (via MiniZinc) to analyze and suggest optimizations for the Rust code.
*   **Actions**: 
    *   **Define Optimization Objectives in MiniZinc**: Based on `project_wide_ast_analysis.tex`, define MiniZinc objective functions for desired code properties (e.g., minimizing complexity, maximizing modularity, improving readability).
    *   **LLM-Guided MiniZinc Model Generation**: Explore using an LLM to assist in generating or refining MiniZinc models based on high-level optimization goals.
    *   **LLM for Code Transformation Suggestions**: The LLM can analyze MiniZinc solutions (which represent optimized code elements) and translate them back into Rust code transformation suggestions.
    *   **SAT Solver for Constraint Verification**: Leverage MiniZinc's underlying SAT/CP solvers to verify the correctness of proposed code changes against defined constraints.

### Phase 3: Self-Recreation and Iterative Refinement

*   **Objective**: Enable the Rust program to modify its own source code based on MiniZinc-derived optimizations and iteratively refine itself.
*   **Actions**: 
    *   **Code Generation/Modification**: Develop a component that can apply the LLM-suggested code transformations back to the Rust program's source code. This will require careful consideration of idempotency and safety.
    *   **Iterative Loop**: Establish an iterative loop where the program:
        1.  Analyzes its own code (Phase 1).
        2.  Optimizes using MiniZinc/LLM (Phase 2).
        3.  Modifies its own source (Phase 3).
        4.  Re-analyzes, creating a self-improving cycle.
    *   **Profiling and Feedback**: Integrate more detailed profiling to measure the impact of self-modifications and feed this data back into the optimization objectives.

## Challenges and Considerations

*   **FFI Stability**: As highlighted in `quasi_meta_introspection_sop.tex`, FFI stability remains a critical challenge. Robust error handling and testing will be paramount.
*   **Complexity of AST-to-MiniZinc Mapping**: Translating complex Rust AST structures into MiniZinc models will require careful design.
*   **LLM Integration**: Managing external LLM API calls, prompt engineering, and interpreting LLM outputs will be complex.
*   **Safety of Self-Modification**: Ensuring that the program does not introduce bugs or break itself during self-recreation will require rigorous testing and validation. The "add-only, never edit" philosophy should be applied where possible.
*   **Performance**: The analysis and optimization steps could be computationally intensive, requiring careful performance considerations.

This plan provides a structured approach to building a truly self-recreating and self-modeling Rust program, leveraging the existing strengths of the `libminizinc` project.
