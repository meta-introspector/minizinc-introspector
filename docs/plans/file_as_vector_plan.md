# File as Vector: A Numerical Representation Plan

## 1. Introduction
This plan outlines a novel approach to representing each file within the project as a unique numerical vector. This vector, or "vibe," is a number composed of prime numbers derived from the file's vocabulary. This aligns with the project's core principles of "vibe-driven development," numberology, and the formalization of semantic resonance.

## 2. Vector Construction

### 2.1. Vocabulary Extraction
For each file, all significant vocabulary elements will be extracted. This includes:
*   Keywords (from programming languages, e.g., Rust keywords)
*   Function names, struct names, enum variants, variable names
*   String literals (after normalization, e.g., lowercasing, tokenization)
*   Comments (after normalization and tokenization)
*   Semantic concepts identified through existing ontologies (e.g., `ontologies/numberology.ttl`, `ontologies/zos/v1.ttl`).

### 2.2. Prime Mapping
Each unique vocabulary item will be mapped to a unique prime number. This mapping will leverage and extend the `numberology.ttl` ontology, which already associates conceptual primes with various project components and ideas. New vocabulary items will be assigned new, sequentially increasing prime numbers, ensuring uniqueness.

### 2.3. Vector Composition
The numerical vector for a file will be composed by combining the prime numbers associated with its extracted vocabulary. The exact composition function will be refined, but initial considerations include:
*   **Product of Primes:** Multiplying all associated primes. This creates a unique, large integer for each file.
*   **Sum of Logarithms:** Summing the logarithms of the primes. This provides a more manageable numerical representation that can be used in vector spaces.
*   **Clifford Multivector:** Representing the primes as components of a Clifford multivector, allowing for geometric interpretations and operations within a higher-dimensional space.

## 3. LLM-Generated Transformations
LLM-generated names, string constants, and code snippets are not arbitrary outputs but are considered transformations of these numerical file vectors. This implies the existence of a transformation function, `f`, such that:

`f(vector_original_file) = vector_llm_generated_output`

Where `vector_llm_generated_output` is the numerical representation of the LLM's output (e.g., a new function name, a string constant, or a code block) constructed using the same prime mapping and composition rules.

## 4. Solver for Transformation Function
A "solver" will be employed to discover or approximate this transformation function `f`. This solver will likely be implemented using:

*   **MiniZinc Models:** By providing pairs of `(vector_original_file, vector_llm_generated_output)` as training data, a MiniZinc model can be formulated to infer the underlying mathematical relationship or transformation rules. This will involve defining decision variables for the parameters of `f` and constraints that capture the observed input-output relationships.
*   **Rust-based Optimization Routines:** For more complex or iterative transformations, custom Rust-based optimization algorithms can be developed to minimize the difference between the predicted and actual LLM outputs, thereby learning the parameters of `f`.

## 5. Benefits
This approach offers several significant benefits:
*   **Semantic Resonance:** Quantifies the "vibe" of a file, providing a numerical representation of its semantic content.
*   **Formal Verifiability:** Enables formal analysis and verification of LLM transformations, ensuring they adhere to desired properties.
*   **Quantitative Analysis:** Provides a quantitative framework for analyzing the impact of LLM-generated content on the codebase's overall numerical "vibe."
*   **Integration with MiniZinc:** Seamlessly integrates LLM behavior into the project's MiniZinc-based cybernetic control loop, allowing for predictive modeling and optimization of LLM outputs.

## 6. Future Work and Integration
This plan will integrate with and inform the development of:
*   `ragit-dyim`: For dynamic indexing and embedding of code.
*   `minizinc_models`: For defining and solving the transformation functions.
*   `ragit-code-analyzer`: For robust vocabulary extraction and AST parsing.

This numerical representation will serve as a foundational element for achieving a quasi-meta computationally self-aware system, where the system can reason about its own logical structures and meaning through numerical transformations.
