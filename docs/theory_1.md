## Theory 1: Text-to-Lambda-to-Proof in the Embedding Space

This theory posits that natural language statements can be precisely represented within the MiniZinc embedding space. We can translate arbitrary text into lambda calculus expressions, which are then formally proven using the MiniZinc prover.

This process lays the groundwork for Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML). In this future state, proofs will be extracted from LLMs and subsequently verified using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) and eventually zk-SNARKs.

The embeddings themselves will be calculated and refined with the assistance of an LLM. This LLM will interactively help us construct the MiniZinc models. Once these models are built, we will use MiniZinc to prove their properties. Subsequently, we can derive ZKP circuits directly from our lambda calculus expressions. Finally, the positions of these proven lambda expressions and ZKP circuits will be calculated and lifted back into the LLM's embedding space, creating a self-reinforcing loop of verifiable knowledge.
