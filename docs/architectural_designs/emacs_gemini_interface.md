## Architectural Design: Emacs-Gemini Interface

### Goal
To enable the Gemini CLI agent to launch, control, and interact with Emacs instances running within `tmux` terminal sessions, leveraging Rust as the intermediary bridge. This will allow Gemini to utilize Emacs's powerful text editing, code manipulation, and introspection capabilities, with fine-grained access to individual Emacs functions.

### Vision
This interface will allow Gemini to:
*   Launch dedicated Emacs instances for specific tasks or projects.
*   Perform complex text and code manipulations that require Emacs's advanced features.
*   Integrate Emacs's rich ecosystem (e.g., Org-mode, Magit, Dired) into Gemini's workflow.
*   Enable Gemini to act as a sophisticated Emacs power-user, automating tasks and enhancing development.

### Components

1.  **`zos-stage-session-manager` (or a dedicated Emacs Stage):**
    *   **Role:** Responsible for launching Emacs instances within `tmux` sessions or panes.
    *   **Functionality:** Will be extended to accept parameters for Emacs launch (e.g., specific configurations, initial files to open).

2.  **Rust-Emacs Bridge (New Crate/Module):**
    *   **Role:** The core intermediary between Gemini (via `zos-stage-session-manager`) and Emacs.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   **Command Sending:** Utilizes `tmux_interface` (or similar) to send Emacs Lisp (Elisp) commands to a specific Emacs `tmux` pane.
        *   **Output Capture:** Captures the output from Emacs (e.g., results of Elisp evaluation, buffer content).
        *   **Error Handling:** Manages errors from Emacs execution.
        *   **Session Management:** Potentially manages the lifecycle of Emacs instances within `tmux` (e.g., attaching, detaching, killing sessions).

3.  **Emacs Lisp (Elisp) Wrappers:**
    *   **Role:** Expose specific Emacs functions and functionalities in a structured way that can be easily invoked and understood by the Rust-Emacs Bridge.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Define Elisp functions that wrap native Emacs commands (e.g., `find-file`, `save-buffer`, `eval-buffer`, `magit-status`).
        *   Standardize input and output formats for these wrappers to facilitate parsing by the Rust bridge.
        *   Potentially provide introspection capabilities within Emacs to list available wrapped functions.

4.  **Gemini-Emacs Interface (within Gemini's reasoning/action layer):**
    *   **Role:** How Gemini formulates requests to interact with Emacs.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Define a clear, structured API or command syntax for Gemini to specify Emacs actions (e.g., `emacs:open_file`, `emacs:eval_lisp`, `emacs:magit_commit`).
        *   Translate Gemini's high-level intentions into specific Elisp commands to be sent via the Rust-Emacs Bridge.

### Workflow Example

1.  **Gemini's Intent:** Gemini determines it needs to modify a Rust source file, say, `src/main.rs`, by adding a new function.
2.  **Command Formulation:** Gemini formulates a command like `emacs:open_file(file_path="src/main.rs")` followed by `emacs:insert_text(text="fn new_func() { /* ... */ }")` and `emacs:save_buffer()`.
3.  **Rust-Emacs Bridge Action:**
    *   `zos-stage-session-manager` launches an Emacs instance in a `tmux` pane (if not already running).
    *   The Rust-Emacs Bridge sends the Elisp equivalent of `(find-file "src/main.rs")` to the Emacs pane.
    *   It then sends `(insert "fn new_func() { /* ... */ }")`.
    *   Finally, it sends `(save-buffer)`.
4.  **Emacs Execution:** Emacs performs the requested operations.
5.  **Output/Confirmation:** The Rust-Emacs Bridge captures any output or confirmation from Emacs and relays it back to Gemini.

### Benefits

*   **Leverage Emacs Power:** Access to Emacs's unparalleled text manipulation, code navigation, and extensibility.
*   **Deep Integration:** Integrates Gemini more deeply into the developer's actual working environment.
*   **Automated Refactoring/Code Generation:** Enables Gemini to perform complex, context-aware code modifications directly within Emacs.
*   **Enhanced Introspection:** Potentially allows Gemini to introspect Emacs's state and buffers.
*   **User Familiarity:** For Emacs users, this provides a powerful AI assistant within their preferred environment.

### Future Considerations

*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for Emacs Lisp evaluation and `tmux` interactions.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Handling long-running Emacs operations.
*   **Security:** Ensuring secure communication between components and preventing malicious Emacs Lisp execution.
*   **Discovery:** Mechanisms for Gemini to discover available Emacs functions and their parameters.
