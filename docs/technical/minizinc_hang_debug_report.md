# MiniZinc Hang Debug Report

## Problem Statement
The MiniZinc execution phase within the `zos-bootstrap` tool was observed to hang indefinitely (or for very long periods, e.g., 16 minutes) when processing even minimal Rust code (`minimal_test.rs`). This prevented the completion of the `test-ast-to-mini-zinc` command when not in `--plan-mode`.

## Initial Investigation
*   **`plan_mode` analysis**: Confirmed that earlier phases (AST parsing, DZN/MZN generation) completed quickly. The hang was isolated to the MiniZinc execution phase (Phase 5).
*   **`strace` analysis**: Showed extensive file I/O during MiniZinc startup (loading system libraries and MiniZinc's standard library), suggesting significant overhead before actual solving.
*   **Generated MiniZinc files (`ast_model.mzn`, `ast_data.dzn`)**: For `minimal_test.rs`, these files were very small.

## Root Cause Analysis
The `ast_model.mzn` generated by `zos-bootstrap` for the `minimal_test.rs` example contained a decision variable declared with an unbounded integer domain:
`var int: suggested_numerical_vector;`

While the model also included a modulo constraint (`suggested_numerical_vector mod modularity_prime = 0;`) and an objective to minimize the absolute difference, the unbounded domain for `suggested_numerical_vector` caused the MiniZinc solver (Gecode) to struggle. It would attempt to search an infinite solution space, leading to the observed hang or extremely long execution times.

Additionally, a secondary issue was identified where the `mod` constraint was inadvertently commented out during a previous `replace` operation, leading to an incorrect solution when the model did run.

## Resolution
Two key modifications were made to `minizinc_output_single_file/ast_model.mzn` (the generated model for `minimal_test.rs`):

1.  **Bounded Domain for Decision Variable**: The `suggested_numerical_vector` was explicitly constrained to a finite, reasonable range:
    `- var -100..100: suggested_numerical_vector;`
    This provides the solver with a bounded search space, allowing it to find a solution efficiently.

2.  **Uncommented Modulo Constraint**: The `mod` constraint was uncommented to ensure it was actively applied by the solver:
    `- constraint suggested_numerical_vector mod modularity_prime = 0;`

## Verification
After applying these fixes, the MiniZinc model for `minimal_test.rs` now solves correctly and quickly:
*   **Command**: `timeout 10s /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/build/minizinc /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/minizinc_output_single_file/ast_model.mzn /data/data/com.termux/files/home/storage/github/libminizinc/minizinc_output_single_file/ast_data.dzn --time-limit 10000 --verbose --verbose-compilation`
*   **Output**:
    ```
    suggested_numerical_vector = 12
    ----------
    ==========
    ```
*   **Runtime**: Approximately 0.18 seconds.

This confirms that the hang was resolved and the model now produces the expected optimal solution.

## Future Work
*   **Integrate Fix into Code Generation**: The fix applied here was to the *generated* MiniZinc model. The `minizinc_model_generator` within `zos-bootstrap` needs to be updated to generate bounded integer variables by default or based on context, and to ensure all intended constraints are active.
*   **Further Performance Analysis**: With the hang resolved, more detailed performance analysis can be conducted for larger inputs.
