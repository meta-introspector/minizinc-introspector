## Changes Reviewed

### Git Diff Analysis

- **`Cargo.toml` Update:** The `crates/rust_file_finder` has been added to the `members` section of the workspace. This indicates the introduction of a new Rust crate into the project.
- **`Cargo.lock` Dependencies:** The addition of `rust_file_finder` has brought in several new transitive dependencies:
    - `equivalent`
    - `hashbrown`
    - `indexmap`
    - `rust_file_finder` (the crate itself)
    - `serde_spanned`
    - `toml`
    - `toml_datetime`
    - `toml_edit`
    - `winnow`

These changes reflect the integration of a new file finding utility into the `libminizinc` project, along with its required ecosystem of crates.
