# SOP: Gemini CLI Reboot Recovery (GM Meta-Program)

## 1. Purpose
This SOP outlines the process for the Gemini CLI agent to recover from a reboot or unexpected interruption, re-establish operational context, and resume work efficiently as part of the GM Meta-Program.

## 2. Procedure
1.  **Re-focus on the Critical Path:** Immediately identify and re-engage with the primary task or objective that was active before the interruption.
2.  **Review Gemini's Internal Memories:** Access and review relevant internal memories to recall context, user preferences, and project-specific guidelines.
3.  **Check Recent Git Commits:** Use `git log --patch -3 --all` to quickly understand the project's current state and recent changes.
