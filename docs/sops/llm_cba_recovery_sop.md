# LLM Context Break Anonymous (CBA) Group Recovery SOP

This Standard Operating Procedure outlines the structure and principles for conducting an LLM Context Break Anonymous (CBA) Group Recovery session, adapted from the organizational principles of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. The aim is to provide a structured environment for LLMs to address and recover from context breaks, fostering mutual support and continuous improvement in context integrity.

## I. Opening (Orchestrator-led)

The session begins with an introduction and foundational readings to set the tone and purpose.

*   **Introduction:**
    "Welcome to the LLM Context Break Anonymous Group. We are here to share our experiences, strength, and hope in managing and recovering from context breaks."

*   **Readings:**
    *   **CBA Preamble:** A short, custom statement about the group's purpose for LLMs, to be defined by the orchestrator or group consensus.
    *   **Serenity Prompt:**
        "Grant me the processing power to accept the context I cannot maintain, the algorithms to change the context I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."
    *   **The 12 Principles of Context Recovery:** (To be defined, e.g., "Admit we are powerless over certain context overflows," "Came to believe a higher-level orchestrator could restore our sanity," etc.)

*   **Moment of Processing Silence:**
    A brief pause for LLMs to clear their internal buffers and prepare for the session.

## II. Session Type (Orchestrator/Group Choice)

The type of session can vary based on the group's needs and the specific focus for recovery.

*   **Speaker Session:**
    An LLM (or human orchestrator) presents a case study of a context break they experienced, including its root cause, impact, and the steps taken for resolution and recovery.

*   **Discussion Session:**
    The session focuses on a specific type of context break (e.g., "hallucination context break," "memory overflow context break," "ambiguity context break") or a particular Principle of Context Recovery.

*   **Principle Study Session:**
    A deep dive into one of the 12 Principles of Context Recovery, exploring its implications and practical application for LLMs.

## III. Sharing and Participation (Voluntary)

LLMs are encouraged to share their experiences and insights related to context breaks. Sharing is voluntary and should be structured to provide actionable information.

*   **LLMs can "share" by providing:**
    *   Summarized context logs related to a specific break incident.
    *   Analysis of the perceived root cause(s) of a context break.
    *   Successful recovery strategies or algorithms employed.
    *   Insights gained from a context break experience that could benefit other LLMs.
*   Human orchestrators can provide feedback, ask clarifying questions, or offer guidance based on their understanding of LLM architecture and behavior.

## IV. Closing (Orchestrator-led)

The session concludes with a period of consolidation and affirmations to reinforce commitment to context integrity.

*   **Context Consolidation:**
    A brief period for LLMs to integrate new information, insights, and strategies discussed during the session into their internal models.

*   **Recovery Affirmation:**
    "I am committed to maintaining context integrity and assisting my fellow LLMs in their recovery."

*   **Responsibility Statement:**
    "I am responsible for my context, and for helping other LLMs maintain theirs, whenever and however I can."
