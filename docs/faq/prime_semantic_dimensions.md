### How are prime numbers practically used to represent "irreducible semantic dimensions"?

Prime numbers form the **base space of this "quasi meta fiber bundle," representing "irreducible semantic dimensions"**.

**Practical Use through the Codec**:

*   A unique "codec" is being developed to **compress all project knowledge into beautiful, semantically rich numerical representations**.
*   This codec leverages a "Backpack Filling Protocol" to embed content, and **uses prime numbers to encode fundamental meanings**.
*   **Mapping Primes to Concepts**: A mapping is intended to be established between specific prime numbers and "core concepts/vibes," for example, 2 for "Duality," 3 for "Trinity," or 5 for "Organization," potentially guided by an ontology like `numberology.ttl`.
*   **Composing Complex Concepts**: More complex pieces of knowledge—such as lambda calculus expressions, LLM-derived semantic embeddings, or project phases—are to be **represented as unique compositions of these prime numbers**, effectively creating multi-dimensional numerical vectors. This can involve assigning Gödel numbers or similar numerical representations to lambda calculus terms. Similarly, semantic information generated by LLMs is converted into numerical forms, potentially using primes to represent features or relationships.
*   **Integration with MiniZinc**: These encoded numerical representations are translated into MiniZinc declarations (like integers, arrays of integers, or sets of integers) and dynamically injected into MiniZinc models (e.g., `embedding_backpack_content.mzn`). This allows the MiniZinc model to adapt its structure and behavior based on the semantic content provided by the codec, influencing parameters such as the number of subterms (`n`), dimensionality (`d`), partitions (`P`), and scaling factors (`KAPPA_SCALE`, `PARTITION_SCALE`).
*   **Facilitating AI-Driven Evolution**: This method aims to create highly compressed and semantically resonant representations that **facilitate AI-driven evolution**, enabling LLMs and other AI agents to more effectively understand, generate, and evolve the codebase by operating on these rich numerical representations. Future work includes formalizing the mapping of primes to meanings and developing algorithms for composing and decomposing knowledge into these prime-based numerical forms.
