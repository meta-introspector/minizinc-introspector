## Next Task: Fix `asciicast_processor` Filtering Logic

**Objective:** Ensure that the `asciicast_processor`'s `filter` command correctly identifies and matches strings in the processed output, even when those strings are part of lines containing ANSI escape codes or other special characters that might interfere with direct regex matching after stripping.

**Problem:** The `filter_regex.is_match(line)` check is failing even when the target string ("mini-act" in our case) is visually present in the `cleaned_data`. This is because the `cleaned_data` still contains a leading `â—†` character (U+25C6 BLACK DIAMOND) which prevents a direct match with a simple regex like "mini-act".

**Proposed Solution:**

1.  **Refine `strip_ansi_escapes` usage or add a post-processing step:** Instead of relying solely on `strip_ansi_escapes`, which might leave other non-alphanumeric characters, we need a more robust cleaning step.
    *   **Option A (Preferred):** Modify the `string_processor` module to include a function that specifically removes or normalizes leading/trailing non-alphanumeric characters (excluding whitespace that is part of the content). This would ensure that the `cleaned_data` is truly "clean" for regex matching.
    *   **Option B:** If Option A is too complex or time-consuming, we can modify the `filter` command to apply a more aggressive cleaning to the `line` before passing it to `filter_regex.is_match()`. This could involve trimming whitespace and removing non-alphanumeric characters from the beginning and end of the string.

2.  **Update `asciicast_processor`:** Implement the chosen solution within the `asciicast_processor` crate.

3.  **Verify the fix:**
    *   Run `asciicast_processor docs/asciicast21.cast filter --regex "mini-act"` (with the original simple regex) and confirm that it no longer panics and correctly identifies the line.
    *   Add a new test case to `asciicast_processor` that specifically tests this scenario (string with leading special characters).

**Reboot Plan (GM Meta-Program):**

1.  **Stay on the critical path:** Focus solely on implementing the fix for the `asciicast_processor` filtering logic.
2.  **Review memories:** Re-read the relevant sections of `GEMINI.md` and `docs/recent_build_fixes_and_gemini_utils_refinement.md` to ensure adherence to project principles and to recall the context of `asciicast_processor` and `gemini_utils`.
3.  **Check recent commits:** Use `git log --patch -3 --all` to review the changes made in this session, especially the enhanced panic output, to ensure I have the latest context.
