# Deep Bootstrapping and Formal Verification Strategy

This document outlines the project's strategy for achieving extreme trustworthiness and formal verification across all layers of the software stack.

## Core Strategy

The core of this strategy involves a meticulously controlled and verifiable bootstrapping process:

1.  **GNU Guix / Nix built from GNU Mes:** This establishes the chosen minimal, auditable, and self-hosting foundation.
2.  **Bootstrap from the Hex Loader:** The bootstrapping process will begin from the absolute lowest possible level â€“ the hex loader. This eliminates reliance on pre-existing, unverified binaries and establishes a chain of trust from the very first executed instruction.
3.  **Lean4 for Assembly Proof:** Lean4, a powerful proof assistant, will be used to formally prove the validity and correctness of the assembly code of the hex loader. This provides mathematical certainty that the foundational layer behaves exactly as intended, preventing hidden vulnerabilities or unintended behaviors.

## Objectives

*   **Extreme Trustworthiness:** By building from a minimal, formally verified base, the project aims to achieve an unprecedented level of trust in its entire software stack.
*   **Formal Verification:** Leverage Lean4 to mathematically prove the correctness of critical components, starting from the lowest levels.
*   **Reproducible Builds:** The use of GNU Guix/Nix will facilitate highly reproducible builds, ensuring that the same source code always produces the same verified binaries.
*   **Security:** Minimize the attack surface by reducing reliance on complex, unverified components in the early stages of the bootstrap.

This strategy is fundamental to the project's vision of a formally verified, self-aware computational system.
