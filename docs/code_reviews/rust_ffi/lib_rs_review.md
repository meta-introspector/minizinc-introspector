## Review of `lib.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This file is the root of the `minizinc_ffi` Rust crate. Its primary purpose is to declare and re-export the various modules that constitute the FFI. It also includes the `lazy_static!` macro for global static variables. This file adheres to the "one declaration per file" principle by acting solely as a module orchestrator.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `#[macro_use] extern crate lazy_static;`: Imports the `lazy_static` macro, used for initializing static variables (like `GLOBAL_MINIZINC_ENV` in `tests/mod.rs`).
    *   `pub mod ffi_bindings;`: Declares the module containing raw FFI function declarations.
    *   `pub mod types; pub use types::*;`: Declares the `types` module and re-exports all its public items, making them directly accessible from the `minizinc_ffi` crate.
    *   `pub mod tests;`: Declares the `tests` module.
    *   `pub mod environment;`: Declares the `environment` module, which contains the `MiniZincEnvironment` struct and its methods.
    *   `pub mod model;`: Declares the `model` module.
    *   `pub mod coverage_report;`: Declares the `coverage_report` module.
    *   Commented-out `pub use model::*;`: Indicates a potential design choice or a work-in-progress where `model`'s contents are not directly re-exported at the crate root.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** This file is the central point for organizing all FFI-related Rust code. Its structure directly impacts how other Rust crates (like `zos-bootstrap`) will import and use the MiniZinc FFI.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Organizes the Rust code that interacts with MiniZinc.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Modularity and Organization:** This file is a prime example of the "one declaration per file" principle applied at the crate level. This modularity is vital for the "big idea" as it makes the codebase easier to understand, navigate, and analyze for semantic features.
        *   **Code Oxidation:** By providing a clean, modular structure for the Rust FFI, it contributes significantly to the overall "code oxidation" effort, making the FFI more maintainable and robust.
        *   **Maintainability:** A well-organized crate root simplifies future development and debugging.

*   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** The `zos-bootstrap` tool will depend on the `minizinc_ffi` crate. This `lib.rs` file defines the public API of that dependency, determining what `zos-bootstrap` can directly access (e.g., `minizinc_ffi::environment::MiniZincEnvironment::new()`).
    *   **Internal Module:** This is the crate root.

This file is a key organizational component, ensuring the modularity and usability of the Rust FFI.
