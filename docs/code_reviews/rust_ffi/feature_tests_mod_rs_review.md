## Review of `feature_tests/mod.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This file serves as the module declaration file for the `feature_tests` module within the `minizinc_ffi` crate. It declares submodules containing individual feature test cases.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `pub mod ...;`: Declares public submodules: `test_empty_model`, `test_basic_int_var`, and `test_output_statement`. These are individual test files that focus on specific MiniZinc language features.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** This file organizes tests that validate the FFI's ability to handle various MiniZinc language features.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Directly organizes tests for MiniZinc language features.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Comprehensive Testing:** The existence of a dedicated `feature_tests` module indicates a commitment to thoroughly testing the FFI's capabilities across different MiniZinc constructs. This contributes to the overall reliability of the semantic embedding pipeline.
        *   **Modularity:** Adheres to the "one declaration per file" principle for organizing tests, which is good practice.

*   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** These feature tests would fall under `zos-bootstrap test rust-ffi` or potentially a more specific `zos-bootstrap test minizinc-features`.
    *   **Internal Module:** This file is part of the `minizinc_ffi` crate. The `zos-bootstrap` tool would then depend on the `minizinc_ffi` crate.

This file is an organizational component for the Rust FFI's feature test suite.
