## Review of `test_04_get_model_filename.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This test file (currently commented out) was intended to verify the functionality of retrieving the filename associated with a parsed MiniZinc model.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions (commented out):**
    *   `use crate::tests::tests::GLOBAL_MINIZINC_ENV`: Accesses the global MiniZinc environment.
    *   `env.parse_string(model_code)`: Parses a model from a string.
    *   `model_obj.filename()`: This is the key method being tested, which would involve an FFI call to get the filename from the underlying MiniZinc `Model` object.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** If uncommented, this test would directly validate the FFI's ability to retrieve metadata (filename) from a parsed MiniZinc model. This is important for understanding the source of the semantic content.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Tests MiniZinc's internal handling of model filenames.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Semantic Metadata:** Retrieving filenames (or other metadata) from parsed models is crucial for associating numerical embeddings with their original source files. This is part of Phase 1 (File Ingestion and Initial Semantic Extraction) and Phase 2 (Semantic Embedding) of the "big idea."
        *   **Debugging Past Issues:** The fact that this test is commented out might indicate that the `filename()` functionality was problematic or related to the `isModelString` bug. Its re-enablement would signify a more robust FFI.

*   **Integration into Rust Busy Box (`ragit-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** This test would fall under `ragit-bootstrap test rust-ffi`.
    *   **Internal Module:** The `filename()` method would be part of the `minizinc_ffi` crate's `model` module (specifically `impl_model.rs` or similar), which the busy box would use when processing MiniZinc models. The test itself would be called by the `commands/test.rs` module.

This commented-out test highlights a desired FFI capability that is important for associating semantic embeddings with their source.
