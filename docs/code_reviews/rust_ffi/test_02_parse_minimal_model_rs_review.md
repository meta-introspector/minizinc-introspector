## Review of `test_02_parse_minimal_model.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This test verifies the basic functionality of parsing a minimal MiniZinc model from a string using the FFI. It's a fundamental sanity check for the `parse_string` method.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `use crate::tests::tests::GLOBAL_MINIZINC_ENV`: Accesses the global MiniZinc environment.
    *   `env.parse_string(model_code)`: Calls the `parse_string` method, which performs the FFI interaction to parse the model.
    *   `assert!(model.is_ok())`: Asserts that the parsing operation was successful.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Directly tests the `parse_string` FFI function, which is fundamental for the "big idea" as MiniZinc models (generated from semantic content) will be passed as strings.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Tests the MiniZinc parser's ability to handle a very simple, valid model.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Semantic Embedding (Phase 2):** This test validates the most basic capability required for Phase 2: parsing a MiniZinc model from a string. Without this, the entire semantic embedding pipeline would fail.
        *   **Reliability:** Ensures the core parsing mechanism is functional.

*   **Integration into Rust Busy Box (`ragit-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** This test would fall under `ragit-bootstrap test rust-ffi`.
    *   **Internal Module:** The `parse_string` functionality is part of the `minizinc_ffi` crate's `environment` module. The test itself would be called by the `commands/test.rs` module.

This test is a foundational check for the FFI's parsing capabilities.
