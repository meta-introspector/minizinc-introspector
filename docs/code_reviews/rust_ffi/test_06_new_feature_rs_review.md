## Review of `test_06_new_feature.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This test file is designed to test the parsing of a MiniZinc model that presumably includes a "new feature." It uses the global MiniZinc environment and attempts to parse a model from a string.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `use crate::tests::tests::GLOBAL_MINIZINC_ENV`: Accesses the global MiniZinc environment, ensuring tests share a single environment.
    *   `env.parse_string(model_code)`: Calls the `parse_string` method on the `MiniZincEnvironment` object, which in turn uses the FFI to interact with the MiniZinc parser.
    *   `include_str!("../../../../../tests/new_feature_test.mzn")`: Reads the content of a MiniZinc model file directly into a Rust string at compile time. This is a common and efficient way to embed test data.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Directly tests the `parse_string` FFI function, which is crucial for the "big idea" as it will be used to parse MiniZinc models generated from semantic content.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Tests the MiniZinc parser's ability to handle a specific model (`new_feature_test.mzn`).
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Semantic Embedding (Phase 2):** The ability to reliably parse MiniZinc models from strings is fundamental for Phase 2, where MiniZinc models representing semantic embeddings will be generated and processed.
        *   **Test-Driven Development:** The presence of a test for a "new feature" indicates a test-driven approach, which contributes to the robustness and self-awareness of the system.
        *   **Monotonic Epic Idea:** This test, by focusing on a "new feature," aligns with the additive nature of development.

This test file is a straightforward but important test for the core parsing functionality of the FFI.
