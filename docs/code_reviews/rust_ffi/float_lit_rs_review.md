## Review of `float_lit.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This file implements the `value()` method for the `MiniZincFloatLit` struct, which represents a floating-point literal in MiniZinc. It provides a safe Rust wrapper around an FFI call to retrieve the float value.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `use crate::types::MiniZincFloatLit`: Imports the opaque type for float literals. `MiniZincFloatLit` is likely a newtype wrapper around a raw C pointer.
    *   `use crate::ffi_bindings::floatlit_get_value`: Imports the raw FFI function from the C wrapper.
    *   `impl MiniZincFloatLit`: Implements methods for the `MiniZincFloatLit` struct.
    *   `pub fn value(&self) -> f64`: Calls `floatlit_get_value` via FFI to get the `f64` value.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** This file is another example of how the Rust FFI provides safe, idiomatic Rust wrappers around raw C FFI calls, specifically for retrieving literal values. It demonstrates proper handling of primitive type conversion across the FFI boundary.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Directly interacts with MiniZinc's internal representation of floating-point literals.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Semantic Feature Extraction (Phase 1):** The ability to extract literal values (like floats) from MiniZinc models is part of the process of extracting semantic features. These literals contribute to the overall numerical representation of the model.
        *   **Code Oxidation:** This file contributes to "code oxidation" by providing a safe Rust interface to a C++ data structure, reducing the need for unsafe C++ manipulation in higher-level Rust code.

*   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** Similar to `bool_lit.rs` and `array_lit.rs`, this file's functionality would be used internally by `zos-bootstrap` commands that need to inspect or analyze MiniZinc models, particularly when extracting literal values.
    *   **Internal Module:** This `impl` block would be part of the `minizinc_ffi` crate, specifically within the `float_lit.rs` file as per the "one declaration per file" principle. The `zos-bootstrap` tool would then depend on the `minizinc_ffi` crate.

This file is a good example of how the FFI exposes MiniZinc's internal AST structures to Rust for analysis of literal values.
