## Review of `environment/mod.rs`

*   **Purpose:** This file serves as the module declaration file for the `environment` module within the `minizinc_ffi` crate. It declares all submodules that collectively form the `MiniZincEnvironment` functionality and re-exports the `MiniZincEnvironment` struct itself.
*   **Key Functions, Structs, and FFI Interactions:**
    *   `pub mod ...;`: Declares public submodules. This file lists all the `impl_*.rs` files and `minizinc_environment_struct.rs` that I have been reviewing (or will review) as part of the `environment` module.
    *   `pub use minizinc_environment_struct::MiniZincEnvironment;`: Re-exports the `MiniZincEnvironment` struct, making it directly accessible to users of the `environment` module.
    *   Commented-out `pub use impl_...::*;`: This indicates that while the individual `impl_*.rs` files are declared as submodules, their contents are not directly re-exported at the `environment` module level. This means users of the `environment` module would need to explicitly import from `environment::impl_new::new()` for example, or the `MiniZincEnvironment` struct itself would provide the methods. Given the `impl MiniZincEnvironment` blocks are in separate files, the latter is the case.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** This file is crucial for the organization and modularity of the Rust FFI. It ensures that the `MiniZincEnvironment` and its associated methods are properly structured and exposed.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Organizes the Rust code that interacts with the MiniZinc environment.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Modularity and Organization:** This file exemplifies the "one declaration per file" principle applied to a module. This modularity is vital for the "big idea" as it makes the codebase easier to understand, navigate, and analyze for semantic features.
        *   **Code Oxidation:** By clearly structuring the `environment` module, it contributes to the overall "code oxidation" effort, making the Rust FFI more maintainable and robust.
        *   **Maintainability:** A well-organized module structure simplifies future development and debugging.

*   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):**
    *   **Command Mapping:** This `mod.rs` file defines the structure of the `environment` module, which is a dependency for almost all `zos-bootstrap` commands that interact with MiniZinc. The `zos-bootstrap` tool would depend on the `minizinc_ffi` crate, and thus implicitly on this module structure.
    *   **Internal Module:** This file is part of the `minizinc_ffi` crate.

This file is a key organizational component, ensuring the modularity of the Rust FFI.
