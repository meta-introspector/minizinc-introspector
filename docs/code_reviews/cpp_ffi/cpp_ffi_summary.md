### 10. Solver Interaction

These files implement the C functions for interacting with the MiniZinc solver.

*   **`minizinc_solver_free.cpp`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Implements the `minizinc_solver_free` C function, which frees the memory associated with a MiniZinc solver object.
    *   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":** Crucial for memory management and preventing leaks when dealing with solver instances.
    *   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):** Called by `minizinc_ffi::environment::MiniZincEnvironment::drop()` (implicitly via `MiniZincEnvironment`'s `Drop` implementation).

*   **`minizinc_solver_get_solver_instance.cpp`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Implements the `minizinc_solver_get_solver_instance` C function, which retrieves an opaque pointer to the MiniZinc solver instance.
    *   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":** Provides the handle to control the solving process.
    *   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):** Used by `minizinc_ffi::environment::MiniZincEnvironment::get_solver_instance()`.

*   **`minizinc_solver_instance_next.cpp`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Implements the `minizinc_solver_instance_next` C function, which advances the MiniZinc solver to the next solution.
    *   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":** Core function for iterating through solutions found by the MiniZinc solver, essential for extracting numerical embeddings.
    *   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):** Used by `minizinc_ffi::environment::MiniZincEnvironment::solver_instance_next()`.

*   **`minizinc_solver_instance_print_solution.cpp`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Implements the `minizinc_solver_instance_print_solution` C function, which instructs the MiniZinc solver to print the current solution.
    *   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":** Useful for debugging and human-readable output of solutions.
    *   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):** Used by `minizinc_ffi::environment::MiniZincEnvironment::solver_instance_print_solution()`.

*   **`minizinc_solver_get_solution_value_int.cpp`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Implements the `minizinc_solver_get_solution_value_int` C function, which retrieves the integer value of a specified variable from the current MiniZinc solution.
    *   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":** Absolutely vital for extracting the numerical embeddings (integer values of variables) from MiniZinc solutions.
    *   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):** Used by `minizinc_ffi::environment::MiniZincEnvironment::get_solution_value_int()`.

*   **`minizinc_solver_run.cpp`**:
    *   **Purpose:** Implements the `minizinc_solver_run` C function, which likely executes the MiniZinc solver for a given model and data. (This might be a higher-level function that orchestrates solving).
    *   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":** Provides a direct way to trigger the solving process.
    *   **Integration into ZOS Busy Box (`zos-bootstrap`):** Could be used by `zos-bootstrap run` commands to initiate solving.
