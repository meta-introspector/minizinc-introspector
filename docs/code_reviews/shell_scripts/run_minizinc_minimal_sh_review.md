## Review of `run_minizinc_minimal.sh`

*   **Purpose:** This is a minimal script designed to run a MiniZinc model and output errors directly to stderr, primarily for quick debugging without generating full proof tapes. It's a stripped-down version of the `run_embedding_model_vX.sh` scripts.
*   **Key Commands and Dependencies:**
    *   `source "$(dirname "$0")"/../.env`: Sources environment variables.
    *   Input parameters: Takes 6 version parameters for model and data files, similar to `v6` scripts.
    *   Dynamic file path construction: Constructs paths to the specific versioned `.mzn` and `.dzn` files.
    *   `TEMP_STDERR_FILE=$(mktemp)`: Creates a temporary file to capture stderr.
    *   `${LIBMINIZINC_BUILD_DIR}/minizinc --time-limit 60000 "$MODEL_FILE" ... 2> "$TEMP_STDERR_FILE"`: Executes the `minizinc` command, redirecting stderr to a temporary file.
    *   `grep -v "processing file" "$TEMP_STDERR_FILE" >&2`: Filters out "processing file" messages from stderr and prints the rest to stderr. This is a common technique for cleaning up MiniZinc's verbose output.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Indirectly relevant. It runs MiniZinc models that the FFI would interact with.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Directly relevant. It's a utility for quickly running MiniZinc models for debugging.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Debugging and Rapid Iteration:** This script is valuable for the "Orient" and "Decide" phases of the OODA loop. When developing or debugging MiniZinc models for semantic embedding, a quick feedback loop is essential. This script provides that by focusing solely on error output.
        *   **Efficiency:** By avoiding the overhead of proof tape generation, it allows for faster iteration during development.
        *   **Monotonic Epic Idea:** While it's a debugging tool, its purpose is to facilitate the creation of new, correct models, aligning with the additive philosophy.

This script is a practical debugging aid for MiniZinc model development, supporting the iterative nature of the "big idea."
