## Review of `run_v7_debug_tests.sh`

*   **Purpose:** This script is designed to run a focused set of MiniZinc models using `run_embedding_model_v7.sh` and measure their execution time for debugging purposes. It seems to be a high-level orchestrator for specific debug test runs.
*   **Key Commands and Dependencies:**
    *   `RESULTS_FILE="v7_debug_test_results.txt"` and `> "$RESULTS_FILE"`: Defines and clears a file to store test results.
    *   `RUN_EMBEDDING_MODEL_SCRIPT="..."`: Points to the `run_embedding_model_v7.sh` script.
    *   Variables for model and parameter versions: `MAIN_MODEL_VERSION`, `KAPPA_PARAMS_VERSION`, `OTHER_PARAMS_VERSION`, `RELATIONS_VERSION`.
    *   `CORE_PARAMS_VERSIONS=("v1" "nv2" "nv7" "nv10000")`: An array defining a focused set of core parameter versions for testing.
    *   `"$MINIZINC_PROJECT_ROOT/tools/minizinc_test_runner_rs/target/release/minizinc_test_runner_rs"`: This is the most significant command. It executes a Rust test runner, implying that the actual loop through `CORE_PARAMS_VERSIONS` and calls to `run_embedding_model_v7.sh` are handled by this Rust executable. The script itself is just a very thin wrapper around this Rust program.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Directly relevant, as it executes a Rust test runner that likely uses the FFI to interact with MiniZinc.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Directly relevant, as it orchestrates runs of MiniZinc models.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Debugging and Performance Analysis:** This script is a dedicated tool for debugging and performance analysis of the `v7` embedding model. This is crucial for optimizing Phase 2 (Semantic Embedding) of the "big idea."
        *   **Rust Orchestration:** The fact that a Rust executable is the primary orchestrator for these debug tests highlights the increasing role of Rust in managing the MiniZinc pipeline, which is a key aspect of the "big idea."
        *   **OODA Loop:** This script is part of the "Observe" and "Orient" phases, providing focused data for analysis and decision-making.

This script is a specialized tool for debugging and performance tuning of the MiniZinc embedding models, showcasing the integration of Rust in the testing workflow.
