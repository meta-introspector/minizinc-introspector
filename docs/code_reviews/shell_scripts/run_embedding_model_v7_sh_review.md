## Review of `run_embedding_model_v7.sh`

*   **Purpose:** This script is an advanced version of the MiniZinc embedding model runner. Unlike `v6`, this script *dynamically generates* the `VECTOR_PARAMS_FILE` using a Rust program (`minizinc_data_generator_rs`) based on the `num_vec` value extracted from the `CORE_PARAMS_FILE`. It still generates a "proof tape" for reproducibility.
*   **Key Commands and Dependencies:**
    *   `source "$(dirname "$0")/../.env"`: Sources environment variables.
    *   Input parameters: Takes 6 version parameters, similar to `v6` scripts, but the last one (`VECTOR_PARAMS_VERSION`) is now used to derive `num_vec` for dynamic generation.
    *   `NUM_VEC=$(grep "num_vec" "$CORE_PARAMS_FILE" | awk '{print $3}' | sed 's/;//')`: Extracts the `num_vec` value from the core parameters DZN file. This is a clever way to ensure consistency between the model and dynamically generated data.
    *   `"$RUST_DATA_GENERATOR_EXE" "$NUM_VEC" > "$GENERATED_VECTOR_PARAMS_FILE"`: This is the most significant change. It executes a Rust program (`minizinc_data_generator_rs`) to generate the vector parameters DZN file based on `NUM_VEC`.
    *   Proof tape generation, file existence checks, copying files to proof tape, and MiniZinc execution are similar to `v6` scripts.
*   **Relevance to FFI, MiniZinc, and the "Big Idea":**
    *   **FFI:** Directly relevant. This script showcases a Rust program (`minizinc_data_generator_rs`) interacting with the MiniZinc ecosystem by generating DZN data. This is a concrete example of Rust's role in the data pipeline for MiniZinc.
    *   **MiniZinc:** Directly relevant. It runs complex, versioned MiniZinc models and dynamically generates data for them.
    *   **"Big Idea":**
        *   **Dynamic Data Generation (Phase 1):** This script is a prime example of Phase 1 of the "big idea" in action. It demonstrates how a Rust program can extract information (implicitly, `num_vec` from a DZN, but conceptually, semantic features from code) and then generate MiniZinc-compatible data. This is a crucial step towards automating the entire semantic embedding pipeline.
        *   **Automation and Self-Evolution:** The dynamic generation of data using a Rust program signifies a higher level of automation and self-evolution within the project. The system is now generating its own inputs for the MiniZinc models.
        *   **Reproducibility and Traceability:** The "proof tape" mechanism remains fundamental, ensuring that even dynamically generated data is captured for full reproducibility.
        *   **Semantic Embedding (Phase 2):** This script is the direct execution mechanism for Phase 2, now with enhanced dynamic data input.
        *   **OODA Loop:** This script is a key part of the "Act" phase (executing models with dynamically generated data) and the "Observe" phase (generating data for analysis).

This script represents a significant advancement in the project's automation and self-evolution capabilities, directly supporting the "big idea" by dynamically generating inputs for the semantic embedding process.
