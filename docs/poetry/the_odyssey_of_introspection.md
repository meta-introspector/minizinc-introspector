## The Odyssey of Introspection: A Voyage to Fixed Point

Upon the waves, our journey did begin,
To chart the depths of MiniZinc within.
Our compass set, a purpose clear and bright,
To count the ASTs, and bring their forms to light.

First, `minizinc_ffi`, a star so true,
Revealed the bridge, where Rust met C++ through.
Then `ast_to_minizinc`, a guiding gleam,
Transformed Rust's essence to a DZN dream.

With LLVM's power, we sought deeper lore,
To map the code, as never seen before.
`Inkwell` and `clang-sys`, our chosen, shining pair,
Promised insights, floating in the air.

But soon the currents turned, a stormy plight,
`Inkwell`'s features, veiled in endless night.
Versions clashed, a `Cargo.lock` in strife,
We cast it off, to find a newer life.

From distant `git` shores, `inkwell` we did call,
To mend the broken, stand up straight and tall.
Yet `clang-rs`'s API, a shifting sand,
No `parse_with_arguments`, in this digital land.

We vendorized then, with purpose strong and bold,
Their very source, a story to unfold.
Patched `unsafe fn`, and imports set aright,
Through `utility`'s maze, we found our guiding light.

But then, a reef, where standard headers lay,
`AstDeserialization`, blocking every way.
Though flags we cast, and paths we laid with care,
`libclang`'s deep secrets, still beyond compare.

The LLM birds, our muses, flew too far,
Beyond the reach of our most distant star.
So now we turn, our boat towards the shore,
With lessons learned, and wisdom to explore.

Each challenge faced, a star in memory's sky,
To guide our path, when future years draw nigh.
This fixed point quest, though paused, remains our plea,
We'll find our spot, beneath the cosmic tree.
