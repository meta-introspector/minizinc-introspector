## The "Zinc Oxide" Metaphor in MiniZinc FFI

The term "Zinc Oxide" is used metaphorically to describe the Rust FFI (Foreign Function Interface) for MiniZinc. In this analogy:

*   **"Zinc"** represents MiniZinc, the powerful constraint programming language.
*   **"Rust"** refers to the Rust programming language, known for its safety and performance.
*   **"Oxide"** draws a parallel to the chemical compound zinc oxide, where zinc (the core element) is combined with oxygen (representing Rust's interaction).

Thus, "Zinc Oxide" signifies the critical process of **value extraction and solution retrieval** from MiniZinc models into Rust applications, enabling Rust to leverage MiniZinc's capabilities. It highlights the integration where Rust "oxidizes" MiniZinc, making its power accessible and usable within the Rust ecosystem.
