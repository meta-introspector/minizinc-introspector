# Gemini CLI: `gemini_eprintln!` - A N00b's Guide to Fancy Logging!

Hey there, future Rust wizard! Ever wanted your code's messages to be super clear and even a little bit fun? That's where `gemini_eprintln!` comes in! It's a special tool that helps your Rust programs talk to you in a cool way, especially when you're trying to figure out what's going on inside.

Think of `eprintln!` as your program shouting messages to you. `gemini_eprintln!` is like your program whispering secrets with emojis and smart placeholders! âœ¨

## What's New and Awesome?

We've just made `gemini_eprintln!` even smarter! Now it can do two really neat tricks:

### Trick 1: Emojis Just Work (Mostly)! ðŸš€

Before, if you wanted an emoji in your message and also wanted to put some information next to it, you had to do some extra work. Not anymore!

**Old way (a bit clunky):**
```rust
gemini_eprintln!("Launching: :rocket:", rocket = "stage 1");
```

**New way (super easy!):**
Just put the emoji directly in your message! If you don't give it a special name, `gemini_eprintln!` will figure it out for you.

```rust
let stage = "stage 1";
gemini_eprintln!("Launching: ðŸš€", stage); // The macro automatically knows 'ðŸš€' means 'rocket'
                                        // and tries to use 'stage' as the value for 'rocket'.
```

If you just want the emoji to appear without any extra text from a variable, that's fine too!

```rust
gemini_eprintln!("Success! âœ¨"); // The 'sparkles' emoji will just show up!
```

### Trick 2: Emojis That Change! (Dynamic Naming) ðŸŽ­

This is where it gets really cool! Imagine you want to show a different emoji based on what your program is doing. Now you can!

You can use a special placeholder like `::your_variable_name::` in your message. Then, you tell `gemini_eprintln!` what emoji that variable should represent by giving it a string like `":rocket:"`.

**Example:**

```rust
let current_status_emoji = ":hourglass_flowing_sand:"; // This variable holds the *name* of an emoji
let progress_percent = 50;

// Watch this! The ::status_emoji:: will become the actual emoji!
gemini_eprintln!("Progress: ::current_status_emoji:: :progress_percent:%",
    current_status_emoji = current_status_emoji, // We pass the variable itself
    progress_percent = progress_percent
);

// Later, if the status changes:
let current_status_emoji = ":white_check_mark:"; // Now it's a checkmark!
gemini_eprintln!("Progress: ::current_status_emoji:: :progress_percent:%",
    current_status_emoji = current_status_emoji,
    progress_percent = 100
);
```

In this example, `::current_status_emoji::` acts like a magic portal. Whatever emoji name you put in the `current_status_emoji` variable (like `":hourglass_flowing_sand:"` or `":white_check_mark:"`), that's the emoji that will appear in your message!

## Why is this useful?

*   **Cleaner Code:** Less typing for emojis!
*   **More Expressive Messages:** Use emojis to quickly understand the state of your program.
*   **Dynamic Feedback:** Change emojis on the fly to show different statuses or actions.

Go forth and make your Rust logs sparkle! âœ¨ðŸš€âœ…
