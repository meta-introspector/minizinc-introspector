## Future Tasks

1.  Use our Rust command to send keys to a new session in tmux to launch Gemini in `~/storage/github/gemini-cli` with the pro model for our trusted helper in parallel.
    *Note: Currently, direct launching of Gemini in `~/storage/github/gemini-cli` from this sandbox is not possible due to directory access limitations. This task will require the implementation of the 'new scoping' security tool or a similar mechanism to extend operational boundaries.*
