# Forge Abstraction and Migration Ideas

This document outlines fleeting ideas for future exploration regarding forge abstraction and migration.

## 1. Abstracting Forge Types and APIs

**Idea:** Create a generic abstraction layer for forge-specific types and APIs. This would allow the system to interact with various code hosting platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Forgejo) through a unified interface, reducing vendor lock-in and improving flexibility.

**Details:**
- Define common interfaces for repositories, issues, pull requests, users, etc.
- Implement adapters for each specific forge (e.g., GitHub adapter, GitLab adapter, Forgejo adapter).
- This would involve mapping forge-specific data structures and API calls to our internal, abstracted types and methods.

## 2. Rust Forgejo API

**Idea:** Develop a native Rust API client for Forgejo.

**Details:**
- Leverage existing Python scripts for Forgejo API as a reference or for initial data gathering.
- This would align with the project's Rust-first approach and improve performance and type safety compared to external process calls or Python bindings.

## 3. Migration to Codeberg Issue Tracking

**Idea:** Migrate the project's issue tracking to `codeberg.org/introspector/SOLFUNMEME/issues/`.

**Details:**
- This would involve exporting existing issues from the current platform (GitHub) and importing them into the Codeberg instance.
- Ensure continuity of issue history, comments, and attachments.
- Update project documentation and workflows to reflect the new issue tracker.
