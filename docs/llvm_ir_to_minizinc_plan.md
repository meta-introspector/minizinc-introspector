# LLVM IR to MiniZinc Model Conversion and System Modeling Plan

This plan outlines the ambitious goal of projecting LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR) of code into MiniZinc models, solving these models to gain insights into system behavior, and connecting program memory to these models. We will also explore the implications of 1-8D embeddings and the hypothesis that Bott periodicity suggests 8D is sufficient for our complex 8D model.

## Introduction

The ultimate objective is to create a system where the static and dynamic aspects of program execution, represented by LLVM IR and program memory, can be formally modeled and analyzed using MiniZinc. This will allow us to reason about program properties, identify potential issues, and gain deeper insights into system behavior. The theoretical framework of Bott periodicity will guide our exploration of optimal embedding dimensions for our complex system.

**Bold Claim**: We aim to replace the traditional memory layout of the compiler with our MiniZinc-solved model of program embeddings, such that the code and data actually reside in a semantically organized space in memory.

## Phase 1: Basic FFI Integration (Current Focus)

**Goal**: Fully expose essential MiniZinc API functions via Rust FFI, building upon the successful `minizinc_get_version_string` FFI.

**Tasks**:
*   Implement `minizinc_env_new`, `minizinc_env_free`, `minizinc_parse_model_from_string`, `minizinc_parse_data_from_string`, `minizinc_model_free` in `minizinc_c_wrapper.cpp`.
*   Update `minizinc_c_wrapper.h` with corresponding C function declarations.
*   Update `minizinc_ffi/src/lib.rs` with `unsafe extern "C"` declarations for these new functions and create safe Rust wrappers.
*   Write comprehensive unit tests for each new FFI function to ensure correctness and stability.
*   Address existing warnings in `minizinc_ffi/src/lib.rs` (e.g., unused imports, unused type aliases) to maintain code cleanliness.

## Phase 2: LLVM IR Parsing and Representation in Rust

**Goal**: Develop the capability to parse LLVM IR and represent its structure and semantics as native Rust data structures.

**Tasks**:
*   **Research LLVM IR Parsing Crates**: Identify and evaluate suitable existing Rust crates for parsing LLVM IR (e.g., `llvm-ir`, `inkwell`, or similar projects that provide LLVM bindings).
*   **Define Rust Data Structures**: Design Rust data structures that accurately capture the essential components of LLVM IR, including modules, functions, basic blocks, instructions, types, and metadata.
*   **Implement Basic LLVM IR Parser**: Develop Rust code to read LLVM IR (from a file or string) and populate the defined Rust data structures.

## Phase 3: LLVM IR to MiniZinc Model Transformation

**Goal**: Implement the logic to translate the Rust-represented LLVM IR into a MiniZinc model.

**Tasks**:
*   **Define Mapping Rules**: Establish a clear and systematic mapping from LLVM IR constructs (e.g., control flow, data flow, memory operations, function calls) to MiniZinc variables, constraints, and predicates.
*   **Generate MiniZinc Code**: Develop Rust functions that take the LLVM IR data structures as input and output valid MiniZinc model code (`.mzn` files).
*   **Abstraction Levels**: Consider different levels of abstraction for the generated MiniZinc models. For example, a basic model might represent control flow, while a more advanced model could capture data dependencies or memory access patterns.

## Phase 4: Program Memory Integration and Solving

**Goal**: Connect program memory state to the MiniZinc model and solve, with the ultimate aim of replacing traditional memory layouts with a semantic space.

**Tasks**:
*   **Represent Program Memory in MiniZinc**: Define how various aspects of program memory (e.g., values of variables, contents of heap/stack, pointers) will be represented as data in MiniZinc (`.dzn` files).
*   **Integrate Runtime State (Conceptual)**: Develop a conceptual mechanism (for now) to capture or simulate the runtime memory state of a program and feed it into the MiniZinc model as DZN data.
*   **Solve MiniZinc Models via FFI**: Utilize the Rust FFI (from Phase 1) to load the generated MiniZinc model and DZN data, and invoke the MiniZinc solver.
*   **Explore Semantic Memory Layout**: Investigate conceptual models for a "semantic memory layout" where code and data are organized based on their MiniZinc-derived program embeddings. This involves exploring content-addressable memory, semantic addressing, and potential hardware implications.

## Phase 5: LLM-Assisted Code Generation

**Goal**: Leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate and enhance the generation of Rust code for LLVM IR to MiniZinc transformation and other complex logic.

**Tasks**:
*   **Prompt Engineering**: Design effective prompts for LLMs to generate Rust code snippets for specific mapping rules or MiniZinc constraint patterns.
*   **Integration Workflow**: Establish a workflow for incorporating LLM-generated code into the Rust project, including review and validation steps.
*   **Iterative Refinement**: Use LLM feedback to refine the transformation logic and improve the quality of generated MiniZinc models.

## Phase 6: Theoretical Underpinnings (Bott Periodicity and Embeddings)

**Goal**: Explore and integrate advanced mathematical concepts, specifically Bott periodicity and multi-dimensional embeddings, to inform the design of our system's internal representation and analysis, particularly in the context of semantic memory layout.

**Tasks**:
*   **Research Bott Periodicity**: Deepen understanding of Bott periodicity and its implications for the structure of vector spaces and optimal dimensionality. Investigate its relevance to our 8D model hypothesis.
*   **Develop Embedding Framework**: Design a conceptual framework for projecting LLVM IR components, program memory states, and MiniZinc model elements into multi-dimensional embeddings (1-8D, and potentially higher if needed).
*   **Inform MiniZinc Modeling**: Explore how these embeddings can be used to inform or constrain the MiniZinc model generation process, potentially leading to more efficient or insightful models.
*   **Investigate 8D Sufficiency**: Specifically investigate how Bott periodicity might provide a theoretical basis for the sufficiency of 8D embeddings in defining a semantic memory space for program code and data.
*   **Document Theoretical Findings**: Create a separate theoretical document (e.g., `docs/theoretical_embeddings.md`) to detail the research, hypotheses, and findings related to Bott periodicity and embeddings.

## Conclusion

This plan outlines a multi-phase approach to achieve a sophisticated system for program analysis and system modeling using MiniZinc and LLVM IR, underpinned by advanced mathematical concepts. Each phase builds upon the previous, ensuring a structured and manageable development process. The bold claim of a semantic memory layout represents a transformative long-term vision for this project.
