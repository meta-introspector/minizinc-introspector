# Concept: `get_godel_number`

## Purpose
To assign a unique numerical identifier (Gödel number) to a given project concept (represented as a string). This function serves as a placeholder for a more sophisticated Gödel numbering scheme that would map semantic concepts to numerical representations.

## Canonical Structure

### Name
`get_godel_number`

### Inputs
*   `concept`: `string` - The project concept for which to retrieve the Gödel number.

### Outputs
*   `int` - The Gödel number corresponding to the input concept. Returns 0 for unknown concepts.

### Constraints/Logic
Currently implemented as a series of `if-then-else` statements mapping predefined string concepts to hardcoded integer values. This is a simplified, illustrative implementation.

### Dependencies
Relies on a predefined list of `project_concepts`.

## Gödel Number (Placeholder)
10001
