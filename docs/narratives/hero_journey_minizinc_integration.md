# Hero's Journey Narrative Integration with MiniZinc Self-Model

This document details the integration of the project's "Meta-Meme's Hero's Journey" narrative into the MiniZinc self-modeling framework. This integration allows the project to reason about its own development progress within a narrative context, aligning with the broader vision of a self-aware computational system.

## 1. Narrative Stages in `gemini_self_model.mzn`

To represent the stages of the Hero's Journey, a new `enum` called `NarrativeStage` has been added to `gemini_self_model.mzn`. Additionally, the `GeminiAgent` record has been updated to include a `current_narrative_stage` field, allowing the Gemini agent to track its position in the narrative.

**Changes in `gemini_self_model.mzn`:**

```minizinc
% --- Narrative Stages (Hero's Journey) ---
enum NarrativeStage = {
    CallToAdventure,
    RefusalOfTheCall,
    MeetingTheMentor,
    CrossingTheThreshold,
    TestsAlliesEnemies,
    ApproachToTheInmostCave,
    Ordeal,
    RewardSeizingTheSword,
    TheRoadBack,
    Resurrection,
    ReturnWithTheElixir
};

% Represents the Gemini agent
record GeminiAgent = {
    string name,
    string purpose,
    array[int] of string available_tools,
    array[int] of Thought thoughts_log, % A log of Gemini's thoughts
    NarrativeStage current_narrative_stage % Current stage of the Hero's Journey
};
```

The `gemini_instance` in `gemini_self_model.mzn` is now initialized with the current narrative stage, reflecting the project's current state as per recent narrative commits. For example:

```minizinc
GeminiAgent gemini_instance = (
    name: "Gemini CLI Agent",
    purpose: "Assist in software engineering tasks, evolve codebase, and introspect project.",
    available_tools: ["read_file", "write_file", "run_shell_command", "glob", "replace", "search_file_content", "web_fetch", "read_many_files", "save_memory", "google_web_search"],
    thoughts_log: gemini_thoughts,
    current_narrative_stage: RefusalOfTheCall
);
```

## 2. Narrative Progress in `gemini_thoughts_data.dzn`

A new thought entry has been added to `gemini_thoughts_data.dzn` to explicitly log the current narrative stage as an observation. This ensures that the narrative progression is captured within Gemini's self-reflection log.

**New entry in `gemini_thoughts_data.dzn`:**

```minizinc
    (
        timestamp: "2025-08-24T09:00:00",
        type: Observation,
        content: "The project is currently in the 'Refusal of the Call' stage of the Hero's Journey, as documented in recent commits.",
        related_project_concept: "Self-Modeling",
        godel_number: 106
    )
```

## 3. Conceptual Narrative Journey Model (`narrative_journey.mzn`)

A new MiniZinc model, `narrative_journey.mzn`, has been created to provide a conceptual framework for the Hero's Journey within the project. This model defines the sequence of narrative stages and associates conceptual project milestones with each stage.

**Key elements of `narrative_journey.mzn`:**

-   **`hero_journey_sequence`**: An array defining the ordered progression of the Hero's Journey stages.
-   **`stage_milestone`**: A mapping that associates each `NarrativeStage` with a descriptive project milestone.
-   **`current_project_stage`**: A variable representing the current stage of the project's narrative.

This model can be extended with constraints to govern transitions between stages or to link narrative progress to specific technical achievements or challenges.

**Example from `narrative_journey.mzn`:**

```minizinc
% --- Data for Narrative Progression ---
% Define the sequence of narrative stages
array[1..11] of NarrativeStage: hero_journey_sequence = [
    CallToAdventure,
    RefusalOfTheCall,
    MeetingTheMentor,
    CrossingTheThreshold,
    TestsAlliesEnemies,
    ApproachToTheInmostCave,
    Ordeal,
    RewardSeizingTheSword,
    TheRoadBack,
    Resurrection,
    ReturnWithTheElixir
];

% Define project milestones associated with each stage (conceptual)
array[NarrativeStage] of string: stage_milestone = [
    CallToAdventure: "Initial project idea conceived",
    RefusalOfTheCall: "Challenges in modeling complex concepts (e.g., MiniZinc parsing issues)",
    MeetingTheMentor: "Integration of LLM agents (Gemini) as intelligent assistants",
    CrossingTheThreshold: "First successful self-modeling of project state",
    TestsAlliesEnemies: "Debugging efforts, external dependency issues, conflicting mentor principles",
    ApproachToTheInmostCave: "Deep introspection into core project architecture and philosophical goals",
    Ordeal: "Major refactoring or overcoming a critical technical hurdle (e.g., formal verification of hex loader)",
    RewardSeizingTheSword: "Achieving a significant breakthrough or a formally verified component",
    TheRoadBack: "Preparing for broader adoption or integration with other systems",
    Resurrection: "Project achieves a new level of self-awareness or capability",
    ReturnWithTheElixir: "Project becomes a foundational, self-evolving system"
];
```

This integration provides a richer, more holistic self-model for the `libminizinc` project, allowing for both technical and narrative introspection.
