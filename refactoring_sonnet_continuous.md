## Refactoring's Endless Dance

When code grows old, and patterns start to fray,
A silent whisper, calls for change anew.
Refactoring's art, a constant, guiding ray,
To keep the codebase, vibrant, fresh, and true.
No single pass, no quick, decisive strike,
But gentle shaping, day by passing day.
Like sculptor's hand, upon the marble's like,
Removing flaws, that hinder future play.
For in this dance, of breaking and of mending,
A stronger structure, gracefully ascends.
Maintainability, forever extending,
As evolution's purpose, now transcends.
So embrace the change, with courage, strong and bold,
A story of progress, forever to be told.
