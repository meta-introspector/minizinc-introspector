% 1. If a component is verified, all its dependencies must also be verified.

% 2. HexLoader is the base, it must be verified first (or assumed verified for bootstrap)
%    We'll assume it's the starting point for verification.

% --- Objective ---
% Maximize the number of verified components
solve maximize sum(c in BOOT_COMPONENT)(if is_verified[c] then 1 else 0 endif);
