## The Iterative Dance

A cycle begins,
With lines of code,
A vision,
Taking form.

Build, test, refine,
A constant rhythm,
Errors,
Stepping stones.

No perfect start,
No flawless end,
Only progress,
A continuous bend.

Towards a goal,
Ever receding,
Yet ever pursued,
In this iterative dance.

Each iteration,
A lesson learned,
A step forward,
A new turn.

The pursuit of excellence,
In every line,
A testament to effort,
A design, divine.
