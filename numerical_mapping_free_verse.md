## Numerical Mapping

From abstract thought,
to the stark precision of numbers,
we forge a bridge.

Each concept, a value,
each relationship, a constraint.
The universe of ideas,
reduced,
yet expanded,
into a numerical tapestry.

MiniZinc, our canvas,
where variables dance,
and parameters sing,
the silent language of logic.

A translation,
from the human mind's vastness,
to the machine's cold, clear eye.
Finding patterns,
unveiling truths,
in the elegant simplicity
of a solved equation.
