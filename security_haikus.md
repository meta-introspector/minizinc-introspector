## Security Haikus

### Security's Shield
Walls of code arise,
Guarding secrets, strong and true,
Safe, from prying eyes.

### Privacy's Veil
Data, held so close,
Whispers, only meant for few,
Trust, a fragile bond.

### Trust's Foundation
System, built with care,
Promises, faithfully kept,
Future, now secure.
