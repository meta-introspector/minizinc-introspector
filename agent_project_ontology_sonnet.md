## The Agent's Semantic Dance

Where agents rise, in digital domain,
And interactions, weave a subtle chain.
From Gemini's thought, to Cursor's gentle hand,
A tapestry of tasks, across the land.
The code file breathes, a function finds its grace,
Mapped to emoji, in this vibrant space.
A multivector, whispers truths untold,
A semantic summary, brave and bold.
Each sieve address, a pathway, clear and bright,
Illuminating knowledge, with its light.
For in this dance, of symbol and of sense,
A deeper meaning, finds its recompense.
So agents learn, and projects now unfold,
A story of intelligence, to be told.
