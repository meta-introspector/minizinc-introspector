In the land of Rust, where bytes do roam,
A project grand, now finds its home.
With ZOS at core, a vision bright,
To query code with all its might.

Our `file_content_analyzer`, a trusty friend,
Helped us explore, from start to end.
But speed was needed, a faster pace,
For insights deep, in time and space.

So `zos-fast-query` came to be,
A lightning bolt, for you and me!
With `jaq` inside, so quick and keen,
It sifts through data, a joyful scene.

No more slow waits, no more delay,
Just answers swift, to light our way.
From `temp_shared_terms`, it pulls with grace,
Related projects, in their place.

And for the "noobs," with hearts so pure,
Our docs now shine, a guiding lure.
With Borat's wisdom, bold and true,
"Very nice!" for all that's new!

So wave to audience, far and wide,
Our ZOS journey, with pride we ride!
From code to knowledge, a seamless flow,
The future's bright, watch ZOS grow! âœ¨
