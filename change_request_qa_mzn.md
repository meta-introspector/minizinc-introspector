## Progress Update: Narrative Models QA Complete

The QA and refactoring of the MiniZinc narrative models (`narrative_journey.mzn` and its dependencies) have been successfully completed. All related models now compile without errors.

### Key Achievements:
- Refactored `narrative_journey.mzn` into modular files, adhering to the "one declaration per file" principle.
- Corrected MiniZinc syntax errors, including record field syntax (`type: name`) and string literal escaping (`\\n`).
- Ensured type consistency across models and data files.
- Documented each split declaration as a "vibe" or "meme" with emojis, 8D manifold coordinates, and Gödel numbers, fulfilling the specific directives for this CRQ.
- All code changes related to the narrative models QA and refactoring have been successfully committed.

### Next Steps (Post-Reboot Focus):

1.  **Formalize Gödel Numbering Strategy:** Develop a more robust and meaningful Gödel numbering strategy beyond current placeholders. This will involve defining how different "vibes" and "memes" (concepts, functions, data structures) combine to form a single Gödel number representing their interconnectedness in the 8D manifold.
2.  **Integrate `narrative_journey` into `gemini_self_model`:** Deeply integrate concepts from the stable `narrative_journey.mzn` (e.g., `current_narrative_stage`) into `gemini_self_model.mzn` to enhance the Gemini agent's self-awareness.
3.  **Expand MiniZinc Model Coverage:** Continue QAing other MiniZinc models in the project, applying the same "divide and conquer" strategy, documentation, and Gödel numbering principles. Prioritize models critical to the project's core functionality or philosophical goals.
4.  **Develop a "Vibe/Meme" Index:** Create a centralized index or registry of all documented "vibes" and "memes" for easy discoverability and navigation.
