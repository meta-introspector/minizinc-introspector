## Build and Debug

Build, build, build the code so high,
Watch the compiler, passing by.
If it fails, oh dear, oh dear,
Debug, debug, make it clear!

Patch, patch, patch the little bug,
Give the system a gentle hug.
Run the tests, with all your might,
Make sure everything's just right!

MiniZinc, MiniZinc, what do you say?
Parse the data, come what may.
If it's tricky, don't you fret,
We'll get it working, you can bet!
