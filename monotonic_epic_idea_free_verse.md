## The Monotonic Epic Idea

No turning back, no past erased,
The code evolves, a steady pace.
An add-only truth, a sacred vow,
New modules bloom, right here, right now.

Each function, pure, a vibrant hue,
Extending purpose, fresh and new.
Composition's art, a graceful dance,
Enhancing power, with every glance.

Immutability, our guiding star,
Traceability, no matter how far.
The history clear, a crystal stream,
A perfect, ever-growing dream.

So build we must, with careful hand,
A future forged, across the land.
No edits mar, no changes hide,
Just pure creation, side by side.
