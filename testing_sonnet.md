## The Test's Unyielding Gaze

When code is born, from logic's fertile mind,
A crucial journey, it must now embark.
The test's keen eye, no flaw it leaves behind,
A guiding light, dispelling every dark.
From smallest unit, to the grand design,
Integration's dance, and end-to-end's embrace.
Each path explored, each function, pure and fine,
Ensuring truth, in every time and space.
No bug can hide, no error can escape,
The vigilant watch, of automated might.
A safety net, a promise it will keep,
To bring the system, into purest light.
So praise the tests, that tirelessly endure,
A codebase strong, reliable, and pure.
