## The Numberology's Song

In Turtle's embrace,
a new ontology sings.
Numberology's truth,
unfurling its design.

Primes, not just numbers,
but concepts,
vibrations of meaning.
Two, duality's dance,
Three, structure's firm embrace.

Five, the organizing hand,
Seven, completion's grace.
Eleven, modularity's call,
Thirteen, integration's art.

Seventeen, abstraction's height,
Nineteen, cycles, ever bright.
Each a factor,
of the Monster's grand design,
A cosmic symphony,
in every line.
