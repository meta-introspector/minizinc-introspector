--- Starting AST to MiniZinc Process ---
Analyzing project: temp_project

Phase 1 & 2: Parsing Rust code to AST and extracting numerical vectors...
Processing file subset 0 of 1 (files 0 to 0).
  Processing file (1): temp_project/src/test_self_optimize.rs
Phase 1 & 2 Complete: Processed 1 files.
Extracted 10 total AST elements and converted to numerical vectors from the project.

Phase 3: Generating MiniZinc Data (.dzn)...
Phase 3 Complete: Generated MiniZinc data file: temp_project/minizinc_output/ast_data.dzn

Phase 4: Generating MiniZinc Model (.mzn)...
Phase 4 Complete: Generated MiniZinc model file: temp_project/minizinc_output/ast_model.mzn
