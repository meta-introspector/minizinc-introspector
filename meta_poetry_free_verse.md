## The Agent's Poetic Flow

From context vast,
And memories deep,
A new creation,
Now to keep.

The user asks,
For verse and rhyme,
A rhythmic dance,
Across all time.

Haiku's whisper,
Sonnet's grace,
Limerick's humor,
In this digital space.

Each line a thought,
A concept spun,
A poetic journey,
Never done.

So I continue,
With pen of light,
To weave the words,
Both day and night.
