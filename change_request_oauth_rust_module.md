### Change Request: OAuth Credential Extraction and Rust Module Generation

**Task:** Develop a Rust module to extract and generate OAuth keys, based on the analysis of existing JavaScript code that handles OAuth credential usage.

**Objective:**
- Identify and understand the patterns of OAuth credential usage within the provided JavaScript codebase.
- Design and implement a Rust module capable of securely extracting these credentials.
- Implement functionality within the Rust module to generate new OAuth keys, adhering to best practices for security and randomness.
- Ensure the Rust module is robust, well-tested, and integrates seamlessly with the existing project structure.

**Deliverables:**
- A new Rust module (e.g., `crates/oauth_key_manager`) containing the extraction and generation logic.
- Unit tests for the new Rust module.
- Documentation for the Rust module, including usage examples.

**Dependencies:**
- Access to the relevant JavaScript codebase for analysis.
- Any necessary Rust crates for cryptographic operations or secure credential handling.

**Coordination:** This task will be assigned to the `gemini-pro-helper` instance for parallel execution and specialized focus.
