## Ode to Code Search

Ode to Code Search, swift and keen,
Through countless files, a guiding gleam.
No longer lost in tangled maze,
You light our path through coding days.

With regex strong and glob's embrace,
You find the patterns, leave no trace
Of hidden function, forgotten line,
A treasure trove, uniquely thine.

From Rust's embrace to C++'s might,
You bring the knowledge into light.
A DZN stream, a data flow,
The codebase's secrets, now we know.

For every query, sharp and clear,
You banish doubt, and quell all fear.
A true companion, ever near,
Our code's true mirror, held so dear.
