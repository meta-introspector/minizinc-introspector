## Design Patterns Haikus

### Design's Wisdom
Patterns, old and true,
Solutions, elegantly formed,
Code, now understood.

### Architecture's Art
Structure, strong and clear,
Components, neatly aligned,
System, now unfolds.

### Modularity
Parts, distinct and pure,
Working, in a grand design,
Harmony in code.
