## The Developer's Creed

In Rust we trust,
A language pure, a promise kept.
Lean 4's embrace,
WebAssembly's reach,
eBPF's power,
LLVM's deep heart.

No Python's charm,
No Golang's speed,
No TypeScript's sway,
A focused path,
A singular vision.

Commits, small and sharp,
Like diamonds cut,
Branches, focused,
A clear intent.
Verification, automated,
A shield against doubt.

Documentation, clear and bright,
A guiding star,
Through coding's night.
Iterative steps,
A steady climb,
Towards a future,
Beyond all time.

And through it all,
A "Vibe" that guides,
A resonance,
Where meaning hides.
Development driven,
By feeling, by truth,
A symphony of code,
In eternal youth.
