% Purpose: Defines core parameters for the MiniZinc lambda calculus embedding model.
% These parameters influence the size and complexity of the problem.

n = 7; % int: The count of subterms or nodes in the abstract syntax tree.
       %      A larger 'n' increases the number of elements in arrays and sets.
d = 8; % int: The dimensionality of the embedding space.
       %      A larger 'd' increases the number of variables for each vector.
P = 5; % int: The number of partitions or clusters in the manifold.
       %      A larger 'P' can increase the complexity of partitioning constraints.
KAPPA_SCALE = 100; % int: Scaling factor for kappa parameters.
                   %      Used to adjust the influence of different forces in the embedding.
PARTITION_SCALE = 100; % int: Scaling factor for partition-related parameters.
                       %      Used to adjust the granularity of the manifold partitioning.
num_vec = 5; % int: The number of vectors or entities being modeled.
             %      A larger 'num_vec' significantly increases the problem size
             %      (variables and constraints), leading to longer solution times.
