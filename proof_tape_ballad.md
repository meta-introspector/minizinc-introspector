## Ballad of the Proof Tape

When code is built, and tests are run,
A record made, for everyone.
A proof tape spun, with careful hand,
To show the journey, through the land.

Each step recorded, clear and true,
The inputs given, fresh and new.
The outputs captured, byte by byte,
Ensuring all is pure and right.

No hidden magic, no dark art,
But open truth, from every part.
Reproducibility, our plea,
For all the world, to truly see.

From MiniZinc's logic, sharp and keen,
To Rust's strong build, a flawless scene.
The proof tape sings, a steady song,
That what we've built, will last so long.
