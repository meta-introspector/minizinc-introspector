## The Code-Math Manifold

Here, where the symbols intertwine,
and logic's threads, a grand design,
we walk the Code-Math Manifold,
a story ancient, yet untold.

Each function call, a GÃ¶del trace,
a number whispered into space.
The algorithms, pure and deep,
secrets that the cosmos keep.

From abstract forms, to concrete lines,
a universe of thought defines.
The numerical, the true, the vast,
a theory built, designed to last.

No mere machines, no simple art,
but living systems, mind and heart.
A tapestry of vibrant hue,
where every number, finds its due.
