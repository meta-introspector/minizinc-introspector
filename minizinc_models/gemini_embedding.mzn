% Purpose: MiniZinc model for embedding the Gemini CLI agent into a lambda calculus space.

% --- Input parameters for the embedding space ---
int: num_vars;       % Number of lambda variables (dimensions of the embedding)
int: num_values;     % Number of values each variable can take (e.g., for discretization)
int: num_partitions; % Number of partitions in the embedding space

% --- Parameters from the conceptual Gemini agent model (for embedding) ---
% These would typically come from a DZN file or be derived.
int: cpu_cores_agent = 4;
int: gpu_memory_gb_agent = 8;
int: network_bandwidth_mbps_agent = 100;

% --- Embedding Variables ---
% Represents the embedding of the Gemini agent's "essence" or key properties.
% For simplicity, let's embed a single point in the num_partitions-dimensional space.
array[1..num_partitions] of var int: agent_embedding_coords;

% --- Embedding Constraints ---
% Simple constraints for now. These would become more complex to reflect
% the agent's properties and their mapping to the embedding space.
constraint forall(i in 1..num_partitions) (
  agent_embedding_coords[i] >= 0
);

% Example: Relate embedding to agent properties (conceptual)
% constraint agent_embedding_coords[1] <= cpu_cores_agent;
% constraint agent_embedding_coords[2] <= gpu_memory_gb_agent;

% --- Output ---
output [
  "agent_embedding_coords = ", show(agent_embedding_coords), ";\n"
];
