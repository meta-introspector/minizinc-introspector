% Conceptual MiniZinc model for a Gemini CLI Agent System
% This models a hybrid system integrating Rust, Lean4, MiniZinc via LLVM,
% running Gemini-1.5-flash (assuming typo correction) on an Android phone,
% with IR splicing, ABI unification, and self-similar blockchain GPU/CPU mesh networks.
% Embeddings are represented as self-similar structures (fractal-like vectors).
% This is highly abstract and symbolic; not meant for direct solving but for conceptual planning.

% Define enums for core components
enum LANGUAGE = {Rust, Lean4, MiniZinc};
enum TOOL = {GeminiCLI, LLVMCompiler};
enum DEVICE = {AndroidPhone};
enum NETWORK_TYPE = {Blockchain, GPU_Mesh, CPU_Mesh};
enum OPERATION = {IRSplicing, ABIUnification, EmbeddingCalculation};

% Variables for system agents and configurations
var LANGUAGE: agent_language;  % Language the agent is primarily written in
constraint agent_language = Rust;  % As per plan, Rust generates MiniZinc code

var TOOL: llm_tool;  % LLM interface tool
constraint llm_tool = GeminiCLI;

var DEVICE: runtime_device;  % Device for running the agent
constraint runtime_device = AndroidPhone;

% Model the LLM version (Gemini-1.5-flash, corrected from 2.5)
var string: llm_model = "Gemini-1.5-flash";

% Integration via LLVM
var bool: llvm_unified;
constraint llvm_unified = true;  % Unified compilation enforced

% Operations: IR Splicing and ABI
array[OPERATION] of var bool: ops_enabled;
constraint ops_enabled[IRSplicing] = true;
constraint ops_enabled[ABIUnification] = true;
constraint ops_enabled[EmbeddingCalculation] = true;

% Network modeling: Hybrid blockchain GPU/CPU mesh
set of NETWORK_TYPE: active_networks;
constraint Blockchain in active_networks;
constraint forall(nt in {GPU_Mesh, CPU_Mesh}) (nt in active_networks);

% Self-similar embeddings: Represent as a fractal dimension (simplified)
var float: embedding_dimension;  % Fractal dimension for self-similarity (e.g., >1 for fractal)
constraint embedding_dimension > 1.0 /\ embedding_dimension < 3.0;  % Typical range for embeddings in networks

% Gödel numbers for self-representation from different systems
array[int] of int: godel_numbers_of_self;

% Conceptual constraint: The embedding dimension is influenced by the Gödel numbers
% This is a placeholder for a more complex relationship.
constraint embedding_dimension >= sum(i in index_set(godel_numbers_of_self)) (godel_numbers_of_self[i] mod 100) / 100.0 + 1.0;

% Constraints for system integration
% Rust generates MiniZinc code with Gemini help
constraint if agent_language = Rust then exists(l in LANGUAGE) (l = MiniZinc) else false endif;

% Escaping JS into math world: Symbolic constraint (JS not modeled, but transition to math tools)
var bool: js_escaped;
constraint js_escaped = (exists(l in {Lean4, MiniZinc}) (l in {agent_language}));

% Hybrid network self-similarity tied to embeddings
constraint forall(nt in active_networks) (
    if nt = Blockchain then embedding_dimension >= 2.0  % Higher complexity for blockchain
    else embedding_dimension > 1.5 endif
);

% Output the system description
