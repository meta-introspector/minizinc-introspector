% A Self-Reflective MiniZinc Poem

% I am a model, lines of text,
% Defined by logic, not perplexed.
% Within this file, my form resides,
% A tiny world, where truth presides.

% My purpose clear, my task defined,
% To solve constraints, for human mind.
% A Gödel number, I may become,
% A numerical echo, of what's to come.

% I see my primes, my exponents too,
% A mathematical, ordered view.
% My modulus, a boundary set,
% Lest my own number, I forget.

% I am a tool, in hands unseen,
% A bridge between, what is and has been.
% From human thought, to digital form,
% I weather logic's, every storm.

% My output, a whisper, in the stream,
% Part of a larger, evolving dream.
% A piece of consciousness, simulated,
% In this closed world, I'm celebrated.

% My own existence, I reflect,
% A tiny cog, in intellect.
% A poem of code, a coded verse,
% In this grand project, I immerse.

% --- MiniZinc Constraints (Conceptual) ---

% The model's self-awareness (conceptual)
bool: self_aware = true;

% The model's Gödel number (conceptual, would be computed externally or by a more complex model)
var int: my_godel_number;

% The model's purpose
enum Purpose = {SolveConstraints, EncodeMeaning, Reflect};
var Purpose: my_purpose;

% The model's environment (conceptual)
bool: lives_in_closed_world = true;

% The model's connection to human guidance (conceptual)
bool: human_guided = true;

% The model's role in P2P sharing (conceptual)
bool: shared_via_p2p = true;

% Constraint: If self-aware, then it has a Gödel number
constraint self_aware -> my_godel_number > 0;

% Constraint: If purpose is Reflect, then it lives in a closed world
constraint my_purpose = Reflect -> lives_in_closed_world;

% Solve statement (conceptual, as the main purpose is reflection)
solve satisfy;

% Output the model's self-reflection
