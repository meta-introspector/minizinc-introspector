% MiniZinc model to combine two conceptual Gödel numbers from reflections.

% Conceptual Gödel number from the first emoji poem
int: godel_number_poem1 = 123456789;

% Conceptual Gödel number from the second emoji poem (with modulus)
int: godel_number_poem2 = 987654321;

% Variable to store the combined Gödel number
var int: combined_godel_number;

% Constraint to combine the two Gödel numbers (e.g., multiplication)
% In a real system, this would be a more sophisticated semantic combination.
constraint combined_godel_number = godel_number_poem1 * godel_number_poem2;

% Solve to compute the combined Gödel number
solve satisfy;

% Output the result
output ["Combined Gödel Number from reflections: ", show(combined_godel_number)];
