% Purpose: A conceptual MiniZinc model describing the Gemini CLI agent.
% This model is a high-level abstraction, focusing on components and interactions.

% --- Agent Resources ---
int: cpu_cores;
int: gpu_memory_gb;
int: network_bandwidth_mbps;

% --- Agent Tasks ---
set of int: TASKS = 1..3; % Example tasks: 1=CodeGen, 2=Debug, 3=DocGen

array[TASKS] of var bool: task_active; % Whether a task is currently active

% --- AI Model (Gemini-2.5-Flash) ---
int: llm_api_calls_per_minute;
int: llm_response_latency_ms;

% --- Execution Environment ---
% Simplified representation of the Android phone environment
int: android_os_version;
int: rust_version;
int: lean4_version;
int: minizinc_version;
int: llvm_version;

% --- Interactions (Conceptual) ---
% Constraints representing relationships between resources and tasks
constraint sum(i in TASKS) (task_active[i]) <= cpu_cores; % Simple resource allocation

% Placeholder for more complex interactions
constraint if task_active[1] then llm_api_calls_per_minute >= 10 else true endif;

% --- Output ---
