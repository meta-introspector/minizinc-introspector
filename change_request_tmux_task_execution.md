# Change Request: Implement `--task` Argument for `tmux_controller create-layout`

## Objective
To enhance the `tmux_controller create-layout` command by allowing users to specify a task to be automatically executed in a designated `tmux` pane upon layout creation, streamlining workflow for common operations like running `crq_updater`.

## Scope
*   Modify `crates/tmux_controller/src/commands/create_layout.rs` to accept an optional `--task <TASK_NAME>` argument.
*   Define a mapping or logic to associate `TASK_NAME` (e.g., `crq-updater`) with the corresponding shell command (e.g., `cargo run --package crq_updater`).
*   Execute the specified task's command in Pane 1 (the middle pane) of the newly created `tmux` layout.

## Impact
*   **Positive:** Simplifies and automates the setup of development environments for specific tasks. Reduces manual steps for users. Improves user experience by integrating common workflows directly into layout creation.
*   **Negative:** Introduces new complexity to `tmux_controller`. Requires careful handling of task execution and error reporting. Potential for increased startup time if the task is resource-intensive.

## Verification Steps
1.  Run `cargo run --package launchpad -- tmux-controller-cmd create-layout --task crq-updater`.
2.  Verify that a new `tmux` session is created with the standard three-pane layout.
3.  Verify that the `crq_updater` command (or its output) is visible and running in the middle pane (pane 1).
4.  Test with an invalid task name to ensure graceful error handling and informative messages.
5.  Verify that the `create-layout` command without the `--task` argument still functions as expected, creating an empty middle pane.

### Execution Log for `crq-updater` Task

When running `cargo run --package launchpad -- tmux-controller-cmd create-layout --task crq-updater`, the following output was observed in Pane 1 (the middle pane), demonstrating the successful execution of the `crq_updater`:

**Commit:** `ca9fe7e6ded6c6458b1d61ffd990063bafedede8`
**Subject:** `wip`
**Description:**
This commit created the CRQ file. The file's initial content serves as its primary description.

**Commit:** `ea49de080e7e34d2e3171164a8b8acaceee84af0`
**Subject:** `refactor(crq_updater): Split functions into files and update CRQs`
**Description:**
Refactored the `crq_updater` crate to adhere to the "one declaration per file" convention.
- Moved functions (`find_crq_files`, `process_crq_file`, `extract_existing_history`, `get_commit_diff_summary`, `find_commit_from_oid`) into separate files within `src/functions/`.
- Updated `src/main.rs` to use the new module structure.
- Fixed compilation errors related to `git2` API changes (`parent_opt` to `parent`, `find_object` arguments, `diff.print` arguments).
- Updated `walkdir` dependency to `2.5.0`.
- Resolved `StripPrefixError` by canonicalizing `crq_path`.
- Successfully ran `crq_updater` to update `crq_launchpad_workflow_enhancements.md` and `docs/sops/crq_updater_qa_sop.md` with relevant commit history.

**Commit:** `ac86ef2eda7bd9de1a4ed252273b284b8d682d16`
**Subject:** `docs: Add Tmux Workflow and Debugging SOP; Refactor tmux_controller and dump_tmux_status`
**Description:**
This commit introduces a new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for Tmux Workflow and Debugging Procedures (`docs/sops/tmux_workflow_and_debugging_sop.md`). This SOP consolidates best practices for managing tmux sessions, executing commands within panes, and debugging related issues.

Key changes and fixes include:
- Refactored `crates/tmux_controller/src/commands/create_layout.rs` to prevent automatic Gemini launch in pane 1, enabling "native worker" execution.
- Corrected module import paths in `crates/tmux_controller/src/main.rs` and `crates/tmux_controller/src/commands/mod.rs` for `tmux_view` functionality.
- Created a new `dump_tmux_status` crate (`crates/dump_tmux_status/`) for comprehensive tmux state snapshots, including session and pane content.
- Added `dump_tmux_status` to the workspace `Cargo.toml`.
- Debugged and resolved compilation errors in `dump_tmux_status` related to `clap` derives and `tmux_interface` imports.
- Updated `GEMINI.md` to reference the new Tmux Workflow and Debugging SOP.

These changes enhance our ability to manage and debug tmux-based workflows, providing better visibility and control over development environments.

**Commit:** `3290a8aa406d8d4352c2702bbafbcd10d2458b52`
**Subject:** `wip`
**Description:**
This commit represents a work-in-progress state, notably including the initial creation of this `crq_launchpad_workflow_enhancements.md` file. It also introduces significant changes across various modules, such as updates to `gemini_utils` for `kantspel` principles and `gemini_eprintln!` macro enhancements, refactoring within `launchpad`'s `dum_wrappers` for Gemini CLI integration, and the introduction of `gemini_cli_options.rs` and `gemini_context_args.rs` for command-line argument parsing.

**Commit:** `[PLACEHOLDER_HASH]`
**Subject:** `refactor: launchpad stage system and tmux_controller layout creation`
**Description:**
This commit refactors the `launchpad` application to utilize a modular `Stage` trait and a dynamic stage registry, replacing the previous hardcoded `match` statement for stage dispatch. It introduces `TmuxStage` for direct `tmux` command execution and `TmuxControllerCmdStage` for orchestrating `tmux_controller` subcommands via `launchpad`. Furthermore, a new `create-layout` command has been added to `tmux_controller`, enabling the automated creation of a predefined `tmux` pane layout. This layout consists of three panes: a top status pane (2 lines high), a middle Gemini pane (50% of remaining height), and a bottom work/data pane (3 lines high). This demonstrates enhanced `tmux` orchestration capabilities through `launchpad` and `tmux_controller`, including splitting, sending commands, and creating custom layouts.

This SOP consolidates best practices for managing tmux sessions, executing commands within panes, and debugging related issues.\n\nKey changes and fixes include:\n- Refactored `crates/tmux_controller/src/commands/create_layout.rs` to prevent automatic Gemini launch in pane 1, enabling \"native worker\" execution.\n- Corrected module import paths in `crates/tmux_controller/src/main.rs` and `crates/tmux_controller/src/commands/mod.rs` for `tmux_view` functionality.\n- Created a new `dump_tmux_status` crate (`crates/dump_tmux_status/`) for comprehensive tmux state snapshots, including session and pane content.\n- Added `dump_tmux_status` to the workspace `Cargo.toml`.\n- Debugged and resolved compilation errors in `dump_tmux_status` related to `clap` derives and `tmux_interface` imports.\n- Updated `GEMINI.md` to reference the new Tmux Workflow and Debugging SOP.\n\nThese changes enhance our ability to manage and debug tmux-based workflows, providing better visibility and control over development environments.", author_date: 2025-08-27T14:28:18Z }]
Updated CRQ file: "./crq_generic_git_tool.md"

## Proposed Implementation (High-Level)
1.  **Argument Parsing:** Update the `create_layout` command's argument parsing (likely using `clap`) to include an optional `task: Option<String>` field.
2.  **Task Mapping:** Inside the `handle_create_layout_command` function, after the `tmux` panes have been created and resized, add a conditional block. If a `task` argument is provided:
    *   Implement a `match` statement or a `HashMap` to map the `task` string (e.g., "crq-updater") to its corresponding shell command (e.g., "cargo run --package crq_updater").
    *   For unknown tasks, log an error and do not attempt to execute a command.
3.  **Command Execution:** Use `tmux_interface::TmuxCommand` to `send-keys` the mapped command to pane 1 (the middle pane), followed by `C-m` (simulating the Enter key press).
4.  **Error Handling:** Ensure robust error handling for cases where the `tmux` command fails or the task mapping is invalid.
5.  **Future Considerations (Out of Scope for this CRQ):** A more advanced implementation could allow users to define custom tasks and their associated commands via a configuration file, but this is beyond the scope of this initial CRQ.
