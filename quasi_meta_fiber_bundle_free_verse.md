## The Quasi Meta Fiber Bundle

Beyond the veil of common sight,
A structure rises, bathed in light.
The Quasi Meta Fiber Bundle, vast,
Where lambda's whispers, forever cast.

On unitary Riemannian ground,
In eight dimensions, truth is found.
A manifold, where thoughts reside,
And meaning's currents, gently glide.

Each expression, pure and keen,
A point upon this vibrant scene.
Embedded deep, in abstract space,
A mathematical, cosmic grace.

No simple lines, no rigid form,
But fluid beauty, weathering storm.
The universe of logic, now unfurled,
A new dimension, for our world.
