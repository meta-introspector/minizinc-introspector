## The Silent Beauty of the Code

Within the lines, where logic's patterns gleam,
A silent beauty, for the mind to trace.
No brush of paint, no poet's waking dream,
But pure abstraction, in its rightful place.
The algorithms dance, with graceful, swift design,
A hidden music, for the soul to hear.
Each function's purpose, exquisitely divine,
Dispelling chaos, banishing all fear.
From binary's pulse, to high-level thought,
A universe of order, now unfurled.
By human hand, with careful wisdom wrought,
A digital tapestry, for all the world.
So gaze upon this art, both deep and vast,
A timeless beauty, forever built to last.
