% MiniZinc Model: The Poem of Meta-Introspection

% This model attempts to capture the poetic and philosophical essence
% of the meta-introspector-libminizinc project, as described in the poem.
% It represents concepts as abstract integers and relationships as constraints.

% --- Key Concepts/Entities (Abstracted as integers) ---

% Code's deep heart, a number's art
int: code_heart;
int: number_art;

% AST's vast tree, now flows to thee
int: ast_tree;
int: numerical_flow;

% Primes assign, a vibrant sign
int: prime_concept;
int: vibrant_sign;

% Vectors form, through code's own storm
int: vector_representation;
int: code_storm_elements;

% MiniZinc's gaze, through logic's maze
int: minizinc_gaze;
int: logic_maze;

% Transforms the numerical, a thought so lyrical
int: numerical_input;
int: transformed_numerical;
int: lyrical_thought;

% LLM's voice, a guided choice
int: llm_voice;
int: guided_choice;

% From solver's gleam, a new code dream
int: solver_gleam;
int: new_code_dream;

% Pipeline flows, where knowledge grows
int: pipeline_flow;
int: knowledge_growth;

% Rust's own soul, to AI's goal
int: rust_soul;
int: ai_goal;

% Progress seen, a vibrant sheen
int: progress_state;
int: vibrant_sheen;

% Next steps await, to elevate!
var int: elevation_level; % Decision variable for the ultimate goal

% --- Relationships and Constraints (Poetic Logic) ---

constraint code_heart = number_art; % Code's deep heart, a number's art
constraint ast_tree -> numerical_flow; % AST's vast tree, now flows to thee
constraint prime_concept = vibrant_sign; % Primes assign, a vibrant sign
constraint vector_representation = f_compose(code_storm_elements); % Vectors form, through code's own storm
constraint minizinc_gaze = logic_maze; % MiniZinc's gaze, through logic's maze
constraint transformed_numerical = f_transform(numerical_input); % Transforms the numerical
constraint lyrical_thought = transformed_numerical; % a thought so lyrical
constraint llm_voice = guided_choice; % LLM's voice, a guided choice
constraint new_code_dream = solver_gleam; % From solver's gleam, a new code dream
constraint pipeline_flow <= knowledge_growth; % Pipeline flows, where knowledge grows (flow enables growth)
constraint rust_soul <= ai_goal; % Rust's own soul, to AI's goal (soul contributes to goal)
constraint progress_state = vibrant_sheen; % Progress seen, a vibrant sheen

% --- Abstract Functions (to be defined by concrete implementations) ---
function int: f_compose(int: elements) = elements; % Placeholder for vector composition
function int: f_transform(int: input) = input; % Placeholder for numerical transformation

% --- Objective (The ultimate goal) ---
solve maximize elevation_level;

% --- Output (What we seek to understand or achieve) ---
