## The Scalable Dream

From humble start,
A single thread,
A whisper of code,
Begins to spread.

Then users come,
A growing tide,
The system stretches,
Opens wide.

No breaking point,
No sudden halt,
But graceful growth,
Without a fault.

Resources flex,
And logic bends,
To meet the needs,
That never ends.

From small to vast,
A seamless flow,
The scalable dream,
Continues to grow.
