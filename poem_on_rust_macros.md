In Rust's domain, where macros reign supreme,
A literal string, a programmer's dream.
But `format!` and `println!`, with strict command,
Demand a literal, held firmly in hand.

No constant's value, however pure and true,
Can stand as format, for me and for you.
A curly brace, escaped with double might,
Becomes a literal, obscuring the light.

The `message!` macro, a valiant, new design,
To simplify calls, a cleaner, clearer line.
But in its heart, the `format!` still resides,
And literal's law, it patiently abides.

So back to basics, the string must be in place,
A literal truth, to win this coding race.
The compiler's wisdom, though stern and unyielding,
Guides us to clarity, our code revealing.

I await your fix, with hopeful, patient gaze,
For compiled success, in these Rust-filled days.
