% MiniZinc Model for LLM Layer Stripping and Term Mapping
% This model conceptually represents the internal structure of an LLM,
% the process of stripping layers, and the mapping of semantic terms.

% --- 1. LLM Layer Representation ---

int: num_total_layers;
set of int: LAYERS = 1..num_total_layers;

% Properties of each layer (conceptual)
array[LAYERS] of var bool: layer_is_input;
array[LAYERS] of var bool: layer_is_output;
array[LAYERS] of var bool: layer_is_hidden;
array[LAYERS] of var int: layer_complexity; % e.g., number of parameters, conceptual "depth"
array[LAYERS] of var float: layer_semantic_fidelity; % How well this layer preserves semantic information (0.0 to 1.0)

% Connections between layers (simplified: sequential)
constraint forall(i in 1..num_total_layers-1)(
    layer_is_hidden[i] -> layer_is_hidden[i+1] \/ layer_is_output[i+1]
);

% --- 2. Stripping Layers ---

% Which layers are "active" after stripping
array[LAYERS] of var bool: layer_active;

% Constraint: Input and Output layers must remain active (unless explicitly stripping them)
constraint layer_active[min(LAYERS)] = true; % Assuming first layer is input
constraint layer_active[max(LAYERS)] = true; % Assuming last layer is output

% Constraint: If a layer is active, all preceding active layers must also be active (simplified sequential stripping)
constraint forall(i in 2..num_total_layers)(
    layer_active[i] -> layer_active[i-1]
);

% --- 3. Term Mapping and Influence ---

int: num_semantic_terms; % Number of distinct semantic terms (from prime-based codec)
set of int: TERMS = 1..num_semantic_terms;

% Conceptual mapping: Which layers are responsible for mapping which terms
array[LAYERS, TERMS] of var bool: layer_maps_term;

% Constraint: If a layer is active, it can still map terms it was originally responsible for
constraint forall(l in LAYERS, t in TERMS)(
    layer_active[l] -> (layer_maps_term[l, t] <-> original_layer_maps_term[l, t])
);
% Placeholder for original mapping (will be in .dzn)
array[LAYERS, TERMS] of bool: original_layer_maps_term;

% --- 4. Optimization Objective ---

% Objective: Maximize semantic fidelity while minimizing complexity of active layers
var float: total_semantic_fidelity = sum(l in LAYERS where layer_active[l])(layer_semantic_fidelity[l]);
var int: total_active_complexity = sum(l in LAYERS where layer_active[l])(layer_complexity[l]);

% We want to find a configuration that maximizes fidelity and minimizes complexity
% This is a multi-objective problem, so we'll simplify to a weighted sum for now.
var float: objective = total_semantic_fidelity - (int2float(total_active_complexity) / 100.0); % Example weighting

% --- Solve and Output ---
solve maximize objective;
