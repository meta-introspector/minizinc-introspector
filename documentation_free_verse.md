## The Document's Path

In `docs/` we build,
A knowledge garden,
Markdown blooms,
Each file a leaf,
A thought, a truth,
Carefully tended.

A central index,
The root, the guide,
Through branches of wisdom,
We navigate.
Regular review,
A constant breath,
Versioned, preserved,
For all to see.

No fleeting whispers,
But solid words,
Reflecting purpose,
Guiding hands.
A legacy etched,
In digital stone,
The documentation,
Our project's home.
