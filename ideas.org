my idea is this

1. regex -> function
   this can match emojis.
   state can be created and shared between functions.
2. poem to code compiler.
3. pure functional main.
4. feed functions to minizinc
5. feed to lean4.
6. ai can insert new functions quickly.
7. loose coupling.
8. vibe is the vector.
9. search all poems.
10. interpret emojis
11. poems and memes as code.
