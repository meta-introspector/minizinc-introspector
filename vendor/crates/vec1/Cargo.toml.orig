# Keep feature as to not brake code which used it in the past.
# The Vec1 crate roughly traces rust stable=1 but tries to keep
# as much compatiblility with older compiler versions. But it
# should never require changes to older projects compiled with
# a new enough rust compiler. As such this features needs to
# stay in existence.

# Provide a `SmallVec1` which works like a `Vec1` but is backed by a `SmallVec`
# it's explicitly v1 as I do not intend to do a braking change once v2 is released.
# Enabling this crates serde features will also enable (de-)serialization for the
# `SmallVec1` (but not for the `SmallVec` if not wrapped into a `SmallVec1`, this
# is necessary as you can't implicitly pull in `smallvec_v1_/serde` if `serde` and
# `smallvec_v1_` are enabled).
#
# To enable `smallvec_v1_/union` import it seperately in your crate with the
# dependency enabled (and using a compatible version). In the future `union`
# might be enabled by default.
