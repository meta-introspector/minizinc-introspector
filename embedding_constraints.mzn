% Constraints for Lambda Calculus Embedding

% Unit norm constraints (sum of squares = 1.0)
% This will be challenging with discrete values.
% We will need to find combinations of partition_values that sum their squares to 1.0.
% This might require a fudge factor or relaxation.
% constraint forall(i in 1..n) (
%   sum(k in 1..d) (p_actual_values[i,k] * p_actual_values[i,k]) = PARTITION_SCALE * PARTITION_SCALE
