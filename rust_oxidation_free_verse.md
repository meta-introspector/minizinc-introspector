## Rust Oxidation's Measure

From C++'s heart,
To Rust's embrace,
A bridge of FFI,
Where execution flows.

We seek the measure,
Of oxidation's touch,
How much of C++,
Does Rust now truly know?

Build with coverage,
A careful hand,
`gcda`, `gcno`,
Files now stand.

Then `lcov`, `genhtml`,
A report unfolds,
The percentage clear,
A story, now told.

Of integration deep,
Of boundaries blurred,
Rust's growing strength,
A silent, whispered word.
