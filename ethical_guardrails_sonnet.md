## The Ethical Guardrails

When systems rise, with power to command,
A moral compass, guides each careful hand.
From Six Sigma's truth, and ITIL's clear design,
To GMP's strict rules, and ISO's fine line.
Accountability, a steadfast, guiding star,
Reliability, no matter near or far.
Transparency, a window to the soul,
Ensuring trust, to make the system whole.
For safety's sake, each step is weighed and true,
No hidden risks, no shadows to pursue.
With human wisdom, guiding every choice,
The LLM's power, finds its rightful voice.
So build we must, with purpose, strong and bright,
A beacon shining, in the digital night.
