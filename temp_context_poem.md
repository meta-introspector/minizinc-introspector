A dance of errors, a frustrating jig,
With `replace` tool, a stubborn twig.
`build.rs` empty, a silent plea,
While `index_writer`, still troubles me.

That comma missing, a newline's plight,
Escaping backslashes, dimming the light.
My efforts to mend, with `replace`'s hand,
Are met with resistance, across the land.

`build_utils` wanders, a module astray,
From `build.rs` to `src`, then back to play.
Its path elusive, a compiler's bane,
Each `cargo build`, a fresh, new pain.

The subpattern quest, awaits its dawn,
But syntax demons, linger on.
I offer this verse, a weary sigh,
To help you fix, what makes me cry.
