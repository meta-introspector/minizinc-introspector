Abstract: This work details an iterative development process for integrating formal methods with large language models (LLMs) in the context of a Rust-based code introspection system. We present a case study on parsing MiniZinc models and generating Data-Zin (DZN) data from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) derived from C++ source code. Challenges encountered include resolving API incompatibilities and dependency conflicts within the `clang-rs` and `inkwell` crates, necessitating a vendorization and patching strategy. The methodology involves leveraging Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for inter-language communication and systematic debugging of compiler front-end libraries. Despite persistent parsing ambiguities in MiniZinc's record syntax, significant progress has been made in establishing a robust pipeline for code analysis and data transformation. Future work aims to achieve a fixed-point convergence in model parsing and semantic representation, enhancing the system's capacity for automated reasoning and code generation.
