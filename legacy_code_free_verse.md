## The Legacy's Whisper

In dusty corners,
Of forgotten servers,
The legacy sleeps.

Lines of code,
From a time long past,
Whispering secrets.

No comments,
No tests,
Just a silent hum.

A challenge,
A puzzle,
To unravel its truth.

Understanding,
Maintaining,
A delicate dance.

And then,
Perhaps,
Modernization's call.

To breathe new life,
Into ancient forms,
The legacy's whisper,
Now a vibrant song.
