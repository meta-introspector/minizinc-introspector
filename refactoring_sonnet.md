## The Refactoring's Grand Design

When tangled webs, of code, begin to bind,
And circular paths, perplex the weary mind.
A master plan, with purpose, clear and bold,
A micro-crate design, now to unfold.
First, workspace built, and tests, with vigor run,
To prove the structure, 'neath the rising sun.
Then `ragit-readers`, finalized with care,
To bring the knowledge, from beyond compare.
And last, the cleanup, documentation's grace,
To leave no trace, of hurried, frantic pace.
For in this dance, of breaking and of mending,
A stronger system, endlessly extending.
So refactoring's art, with skillful hand,
Transforms the codebase, across the land.
