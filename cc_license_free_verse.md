## The Unchanged Word

A gift of knowledge, freely shared,
Across the digital expanse, declared.
Our words, our thoughts, a public trust,
To spread the wisdom, as we must.

But mark this boundary, clear and bright,
No altered forms, no fading light.
The original, in truth, must stand,
Unchanged, untouched, across the land.

For in the source, the essence lies,
A pure reflection, to our eyes.
No new interpretations, subtly spun,
The truth, as given, and as won.

So read and learn, and share with grace,
But leave the core in its true place.
A testament to what was made,
A promise kept, a trust obeyed.
