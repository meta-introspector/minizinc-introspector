## The Art of Abstraction

From tangled wires,
And buzzing circuits,
A new layer rises.

Abstraction,
A gentle hand,
Guiding thought.

Complexity hidden,
Details fade,
Only essence remains.

A function call,
A simple name,
Hiding worlds within.

Higher-level thought,
Now takes its flight,
Freed from the mundane.

Building blocks,
Of pure design,
A symphony of simplicity.

The art of abstraction,
A gift to the mind,
Unlocking potential,
Of every kind.
