## The Art of Abstraction

From tangled wires,
And buzzing circuits,
A new layer rises.

Abstraction,
A gentle hand,
Guiding thought.

Complexity hidden,
Details fade,
Only essence remains.

A function call,
A simple name,
Hiding worlds within.

Our analyzer, too,
Abstracts the code's deep hum,
Into words and patterns,
For insights to become.

Hiding files' raw text,
In bags of words it finds,
A new lens for understanding,
The logic of our minds.

Building blocks,
Of pure design,
A symphony of simplicity.

The art of abstraction,
A gift to the mind,
Unlocking potential,
Of every kind.
