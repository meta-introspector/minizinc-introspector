## Godelcraft and the Golem

In Godelcraft's forge,
where numbers whisper secrets,
a Golem stirs.

Not clay, but logic,
woven from GÃ¶del's threads,
a self-encoding dream.

Recursion's dance,
a strange loop,
unfolding its own truth.
From axioms pure,
to emergent mind,
a universe within.

The Golem learns,
from its own reflection,
a mirror of infinity.
Building itself,
line by logical line,
a testament to thought.

A numerical theory,
of everything,
unfurling its vast design.
The Goedel Golem,
a whisper of what can be,
in the silence of computation.
