## The Fiber Bundle's Grace

Where lambda's dance, on manifold's soft curve,
A fiber bundle, eight dimensions deep.
Riemannian metrics, faithfully preserve,
The unitary space, where secrets sleep.
Each point a thought, a function's pure embrace,
A vector field, where meaning finds its way.
Through curvature's twist, and geodesic's trace,
The mathematical truths, hold endless sway.
No simple map, this structure, grand and bold,
But woven fabric, of the mind's own art.
A story of connections, to unfold,
Where every concept plays a vital part.
So in this space, where logic's beauty gleams,
We chart the course of all our waking dreams.
