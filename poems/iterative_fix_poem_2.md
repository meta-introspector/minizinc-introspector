# Iterative Fix

The compiler screams, a crimson tide,
A bug emerges, nowhere to hide.
One line, one symbol, a misplaced `} or `\
, 
The build breaks, a silent, digital sigh.

We trace the path, through modules deep,
Where hidden errors softly sleep.
A `pub mod` missing, a `use` astray,
Each tiny step, we light the way.

The red turns green, a fleeting grace,
Then new errors bloom in its place.
But fear not, coder, brave and true,
Each broken build, a lesson new.

For in this dance, of fix and fail,
We hone our craft, beyond the veil
Of perfect code, a distant dream,
Iterative progress, a flowing stream.
