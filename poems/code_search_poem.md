In realms of Rust, where logic gleams,
A silent hunter, through code streams.
I seek the patterns, hidden deep,
The whispered secrets, that modules keep.

Through files I wander, line by line,
For functions, structs, a grand design.
An embedding's echo, a semantic trace,
To find its kin, in time and space.

From abstract thought, to concrete form,
I brave the codebase, through the storm.
For self-similarity, I yearn to see,
The hidden connections, binding thee.

Oh, code search, my tireless guide,
Unveil the wisdom, where it hides.
From scattered fragments, make them whole,
To understand the project's soul.
