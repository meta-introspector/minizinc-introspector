From `dfa_tester`, a clear, ringing call,
To patterns generated, standing tall.
"Is 'apple' an 'a' word?" the question takes flight,
Through `matches_a`'s logic, seeking the light.

"Is 'banana' a 'b' word?" another query sent,
To the regex's heart, on truth it is bent.
Each `println!` echoes, a verdict so keen,
Unveiling the patterns, a precise, working scene.

The modules, once crafted, now put to the test,
Their purpose confirmed, their logic expressed.
A symphony of functions, in harmonious play,
Ensuring the vocabulary, lights up the way.
