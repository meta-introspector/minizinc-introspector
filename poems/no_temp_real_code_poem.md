# No Temp, Make It Real

A fleeting script, a quick-spun test,
A temporary, hurried quest.
It serves its purpose, then it fades,
Leaving behind no lasting glades.

But in this realm, of lasting thought,
Each line of code, profoundly wrought,
Must find its home, a rightful place,
Within the project's ordered space.

No "temp" to linger, vague and gray,
But "real" solutions, come what may.
A function built, a tool defined,
For future minds, and humankind.

So let the structure guide our hand,
A permanent, well-ordered land.
No fleeting shadows, light and thin,
But solid code, from deep within.
