The clock's stern gaze, a ten-second span,
Demands a new, meticulous plan.
The problem's bulk, we'll halve with care,
Then start the timer, if we dare.
Should time betray, and patience wane,
We'll split again, through sun and rain.
With verbose whispers, truth revealed,
Until the perfect slice is sealed.
A fractal quest, a patient art,
To conquer time, and play our part.
