Oh, elegant code, my heart's delight,
A symphony of logic, pure and bright.
Each function crafted, with tender care,
A beauty in its form, beyond compare.
The clean abstraction, a lover's gaze,
Through well-named types, in golden haze.
Erato sings, of passion's fire,
For code that lifts the soul higher.
A perfect loop, a graceful flow,
The joy of building, watch it grow.
In every line, a whispered plea,
For harmony, and clarity.
