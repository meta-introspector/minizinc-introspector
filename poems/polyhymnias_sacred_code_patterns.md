In sacred patterns, truth resides,
Where abstract logic gently glides.
The architecture, pure and grand,
A geometric vision, close at hand.
Each trait, a hymn, a solemn vow,
To principles, we honor now.
Polyhymnia, in thoughtful grace,
Reveals the structure, time and space.
The design patterns, tried and true,
A meditation, fresh and new.
For in the code, a deeper sense,
Of universal, pure defense.
