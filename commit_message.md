refactor: Reorganize and prune documentation

This commit reorganizes the project documentation for better clarity and navigation.

- The `README.md` has been updated to provide a more concise overview of the project and its new documentation structure.
- A new `docs` directory structure has been created to categorize documentation into `vision`, `technical`, `crates`, and `poems`.
- All markdown files have been moved to their respective new locations.
- Redundant and temporary documentation files have been pruned.
