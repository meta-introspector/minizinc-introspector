## Build Trust Haikus

### Trust the Build
Build, a steady hand,
Incremental, wise and true,
No need to erase.

### Directory's Stay
Build dir, stands so firm,
Changes flow, a gentle stream,
Time, now saved for all.

### Clean No More
Clean, a distant past,
Trust in compiler's wisdom,
Progress, swift and sure.
