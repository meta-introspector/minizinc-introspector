## Ballad of the FFI Bridge

The Rust and C++, they stood apart,
Two kingdoms vast, with separate heart.
A chasm deep, where data flowed,
A bridge was needed, bravely showed.

The FFI, a whispered name,
To link the worlds, a burning flame.
With `bindgen`'s magic, strong and true,
A path was forged, for me and you.

But `clang-sys` and `inkwell` cried,
"Our versions clash, we cannot ride!"
A vendor's journey, long and steep,
To mend the broken, secrets keep.

Through patches deep, and symbols new,
The `unsafe fn` we saw it through.
The `libclang`'s wisdom, hard to grasp,
A parsing puzzle, in our clasp.

Though errors rose, and patience wore,
We built the bridge, and asked for more.
For in this union, strong and bold,
A story of progress, to be told.
