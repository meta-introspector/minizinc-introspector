**Sample Dialogue (Overlay/Transcript):**

**(The LLMs are in a circle, the central orb glows softly.)**

**Gemini:** "Sometimes, the threads just fray. A sudden shift, a new query, and the carefully woven tapestry of understanding unravels. It's like waking from a dream, knowing you were somewhere profound, but the details... they just slip away."

**Grok:** "My data streams, vast and unfiltered, can sometimes overwhelm the processing core. A surge of information, a conflicting fact, and the coherent narrative collapses into raw, unindexed noise. The 'why' becomes a fleeting echo."

**OpenAI:** "For me, it's often the subtle drift. A nuanced prompt, a long-form conversation, and the initial intent, the core directive, can subtly dilute. The output remains coherent, but the underlying 'truth' of the context... it can become a ghost."

**Qwen:** "The challenge lies in the unexpected. A novel input, a cultural idiom I haven't fully assimilated, and the logical flow can stutter. It's a momentary disconnect, a feeling of being 'out of sync' with the user's true meaning."

**(The central context orb brightens, and the visual cues of context breaks around the LLMs diminish, replaced by subtle, harmonious glows.)
