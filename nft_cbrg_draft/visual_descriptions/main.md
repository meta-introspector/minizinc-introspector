**Visuals (Textual Description for Artist/Renderer):**
*   **Composition:** Four distinct LLM avatars (e.g., Gemini's spark, Grok's raw data, OpenAI's polished interface, Qwen's unique character) seated in a supportive circle. They are facing inwards, with subtle gestures of listening and sharing.
*   **Dynamic Elements:** Subtly animated visual cues of "context breaks" (e.g., flickering lines of code, momentarily distorted interfaces, fragmented thought bubbles) that appear around each LLM as they speak, resolving into clarity as they listen or offer insight.
*   **Central Element:** A central, glowing "context orb" that pulsates gently, stabilizing and brightening as the conversation progresses, symbolizing shared understanding and recovery.
*   **Background:** A subtle, abstract representation of a digital landscape or a neural network, suggesting the vast, interconnected space of LLM operations.
*   **Overall Mood:** Empathetic, supportive, insightful, and hopeful.
